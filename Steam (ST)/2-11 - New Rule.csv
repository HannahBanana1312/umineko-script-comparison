Speaker,Steam (ST)
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......I see. So it has begun."" "
Ronoue Genji,"""...Yes."" "
Shannon,"""............"" "
,"Even though Kinzo had received news of six deaths, his emotions did not waver. "
,"The expression on his face as he gazed out the window...was a smile, as though his opponent in a chess game had just made a spectacular move. "
,...It was hard to imagine that such an expression could ever appear on a father who had lost so many children at once. 
Ronoue Genji,"""...Gohda and Kanon followed Rosa-sama's orders and went to call the police. After that, she ordered us to follow your orders, Master... ...What shall we do?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......This island has already been cut off from the real world. Mere phones will serve no purpose."" "
Ronoue Genji,"""Should I have them stop?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Until the roulette is finished, what they do to pass the time is up to them. Let them do as they please."" "
Ronoue Genji,"""......Yes sir."" "
Shannon,"""...Umm, ...what we should tell Rosa-sama?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Didn't I say they should pass the time as they pleased?!! They can sing if they want, dance if they want! They're even free to hang themselves by the neck or jump into a boiling kettle!! Until 13 people die, they can spend their time as they like. If that's too boring, then they can wonder about whether 6 times 9 is 42, or something!! That's the answer to the mystery of humanity and the universe!!"" "
Shannon,"""Y-Yes...! M-My apologies...!"" "
,Shannon cowered in fright at this sudden rage. ...Genji made a gesture as though telling her not to speak out of turn. 
,Shannon couldn't help but regret saying too much... 
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""However, ...you two are also free to do as you wish. ...Genji. And Shannon too. You have done well serving me until today."" "
Shannon,"""Y-Your words are too good for me, ...but, umm......"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""......We are furniture who have sworn to serve the Master. ...We stand ready to serve you no matter the time. ...Until the very end."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...... ............I want to tell the two of you... about everything. ......Shannon. I shall be writing a will. Please copy what I say. ...Genji, please, my usual drink."" "
Shannon,"""Huh...? ......Y-Yes sir...!"" "
,"Nanjo often recommended that Kinzo write a will because of his health, but each time he had, Kinzo had gone mad with rage. "
,"...Ever since then, you'd think ""will"" would've been the word Kinzo hated most. "
,"After hearing such a word come from his lips, Shannon couldn't help doubting her ears for an instant. "
,"Shannon hurriedly prepared the side table and some writing paper. Genji followed his orders and began preparing that usual green, evil drink... "
Shannon,"""I'm ready."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Hmm. ......Where should I begin? ...Shall I also speak of my life? ...It would be fun to leave behind a record of my most memorable games. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"......It can be truly amusing to read the records of old games from centuries past, ...to journey in search of those players' thoughts. ......So, should the game record of my life lead those in the future to go on a journey in search for my thoughts? ...Hmph."" "
,"For a while, Kinzo pondered over where he should begin, strutting all over the room with his hands behind his back... "
Ronoue Genji,"""Master, ......here."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ah, yes. Thank you, my friend. ......Well then. If I am to speak of my life, I must begin by writing of my meeting with that witch. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"...Shannon, begin writing. ...My first meeting with {f:5:Beatrice} took place a long way back. What year of the Showa era was it...? ...It must have been...at the end of the war, so..."" "
,"We took enough time to regain our calm, ......and we each swore to our parents that we'd catch the culprit. "
,It would be a lie to say we weren't still torn up. 
,"...Even now, if we let our guards down just a little, we'd probably start going on a rampage just like Jessica, letting our emotions show with some kind of violence. "
,"According to what Gohda-san said after he got back, right now, Kanon-kun was looking after Jessica. "
,"...Apparently, she was still very emotionally high-strung. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I see. Thank you. ...Maybe a young kid would be better at understanding a young kid's feelings. ...It would probably be better if we left them alone for now."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Rosa-san, ...there is nothing more to be gained by remaining here. ...The phones may not be working, but tomorrow, the boat will come, and we should be able to reach the police. We should leave this place as it is for the police's investigation."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...I agree with Doctor Nanjo. ...Staying in a place like this for too long will be bad for your health. ...Let us return and make some black tea..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Yeah. ...I agree with that. ...Battler-kun, George-kun, are you ready...? Let's lock up here. We ought to leave this place as it is anyway, for when the police come."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""You're right. ......Battler-kun, ...are you okay...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Yeah. ...I've cried all I can. ...I'm fine now."" "
,The police would surely find some evidence during their thorough investigation. ...But we weren't adult enough to wait for that. 
,"...I'd investigated the chapel in my own way, trying to grab the culprit before the police arrived. "
,"...And what I figured out was...absolutely nothing, frustratingly. ...I wasn't able to find a single hint. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Come on, ...let's go out. ...Maria, we're going. ...Don't keep staring at it...!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Uu-."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Come, come, Maria-sama. Let us return... It's cold here."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Father, Mother. ...Thank you for everything. I will...definitely become a man who doesn't betray your expectations..."" "
,George spoke his last words of farewell to his parents. 
,"...After seeing that, Battler followed suit. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Dad, Kyrie-san."" "
,"Just looking at their faces, ...it looked like they were sleeping, ...but that just made it even more painful... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Forgive me for leaving you in a cold place like this... ......I'll definitely get whoever did this... No matter what..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...What is...this? What a repulsive scribble... Did the culprit draw it?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""This is worse than vulgar... ...How horrible..."" "
,"When the door to the chapel was closed, we learned about that creepy scribble for the first time. "
Gohda Toshiro,"""When we first found this, it was already drawn here. ...It must have been made by the culprit..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...So supposedly, the culprit was a witch, and this is a magic circle to summon a demon or something...?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihihihihihihihihihi... This is the seventh magic circle of the sun. Don't you even know that...? Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. Ouch."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Hey!! Don't I always tell you not to make that creepy laugh?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Maria, go on. ...What does it mean?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""It's a magic circle to escape from physical or mental bonds. ...And the part written around the circumference says, 'The Lord has freed me from my chains. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord', in Hebrew."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Sacrifice of thanksgiving...? So, they killed Father and the rest to use them as human sacrifices for this magic circle...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Calm down, George-kun...! This is the culprit trying to provoke us. ...I'm sure it doesn't mean anything. Thinking about it will only poison the heart."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...And, looks like there's some English written here. ...<Happy Halloween for...Maria>. ...I get it. And the key to open this door was handed over to Maria... ...Is that what's going on?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Well, this is the chapel, after all. Maybe Maria doesn't mean Maria-chan, but the Virgin Mary. ...In that case, you could read this as a blasphemy against God, in the name of Halloween. "
Ushiromiya George,"They say witches who make contracts with demons swear to defile God's name at all times. ...In that sense, this really is a witch-like crime."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Sounds like you know a lot about it. ...Did you get that from Maria?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Yeah, something like that."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The chapel, huh? ...They went to all the trouble of calling them out here and killing them... ......Aunt Rosa, does this chapel have some special meaning...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""What do you mean, ...a special meaning?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Well, umm, ......someone carried six human corpses all the way over here and set up these elaborate decorations. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"...We can't tell if she called the six of them over here before killing them, or if she killed them before carrying them over here, ...but either way, it'd take a lot of effort... Why did the culprit ... {i:want six people to die here}...? "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...True. By doing something that elaborate, there would be an extremely high chance of some disadvantageous evidence being found when the police arrive. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"...It is inconceivable that the culprit would fail to realize this. ...The issue now... is why the culprit went to all that effort..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""And that leads us to just one question. ...What meaning is there to this place, where we found the six corpses?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...This chapel...was important to Father. ...Ever since I was a kid, I was given strict instructions never to enter it."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-. ...I came here once too, got in lots of trouble... Uu-..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""An important chapel...? ...Does it have some connection to the Ushiromiya Head Family...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I don't know. ...Father viewed this chapel as very sacred, and he treasured it so much that he had it redecorated several times. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"...But as everyone knows, Father wasn't a devout believer, as his passion for black magic demonstrates. ...I've never heard of him coming here to offer his prayers to God."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...As far as I know, the Master has never come here. We even call this ""the sealed chapel"", ...and, umm, I found it eerie, like a haunted house."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Even though Father even never approached it himself, for some reason, he made the servants give it a major cleaning several times a year. It felt like he kept it clean all the time so that it could be used at any moment."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""And even so, it's called the ""sealed chapel""... ...Ihihi! Maybe it's indiscreet to say this, but doesn't that sound pretty cool? Doctor Nanjo, you're an old friend of Grandfather's, right? Have you heard anything about it?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......I did ask about it once long ago, but I forget exactly how he dodged my question. ...That's right, I believe he said something like... "
Nanjo Terumasa,"...someday, perhaps I too will be able to receive a blessing there. But unless a miracle occurs, that day will never come."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What does that mean? ......What would he do in a chapel? He couldn't mean his own funeral, right?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""I wouldn't believe that of Kinzo-san. ...He was a man much more focused on the living now than matters occuring after death. ......Though, this does seem to be root cause of the current inheritance problem."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then what would he do in a chapel? ......Pray? Aren't confessions done in a chapel too? .........Anyway, it sounds suspicious."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...I don't know the reason, ...but just as Doctor Nanjo said, in Grandfather's eyes, ...all this about not being blessed unless a miracle occurred... was set in stone as far back as this chapel's construction."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""How do you know that...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""See, ...it's clearly written over there. ...Look, right there."" "
,George-aniki pointed to a relief with rusted gold letters on the arch above the door. 
,It looked like some message had been written there in English. ...The rust made it clear that the message had been there ever since the chapel's construction. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I'm not that good with English. ...What is it...? ...<This door is...opened...only at...probability of>?? Sorry, my English sucks."" "
,I gave up after failing to finish even the first of the two lines. ...It looked like the others could read it properly. 
Ushiromiya George,"""...Umm, I think it went ""m"", ""b"", ""t"", ""q"", so, ...umm, umm...how many did that mean, I think...umm...hmmm... ...... "
Ushiromiya George,"...Anyway, this is incredible. Adding up all the fingers on both hands doesn't even get you close. It really would be impossible unless a miracle occurred."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...Certainly. It's quite reminiscent of the old Kinzo-san, who loved using gambling as a metaphor whenever he got the chance."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Hey, come on, can everyone read it? Someone tell me what it means too."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihihihihihi. ...You've gotta at least learn English. How did you get into high school without even being able to read this much? Kihihihihihihihihihi, ouch. Ouch ouch ouch."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Mind your own business. So, what's written there?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Simply put, it means something like this: 'Unless a miracle occurs, this door will never be opened. Unless a miracle occurs, you will never be blessed'."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Grandfather's magic is based on astronomically low probabilities. ...In other words, a miracle for opening this door...would probably require an incredibly vast amount of magical power. ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. Ouch."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Nice job, you can shut up now. Rosa-san, did you have Maria take English classes? Looks like it's useless to try and learn English unless you start when you're young after all."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......The sealed chapel, huh? ...Setting aside whether she was a witch or not, it's rumored that {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed several decades ago... and was Grandfather's mistress."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""This is, umm, just my imagination, ...but perhaps the Master truly did love {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. However, he was already married, so they couldn't be united."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I see. ......If {f:5:Beatrice} was dead and could be revived with the magic of a miracle, then now that Grandmother's dead, he could marry her openly. And if they married in this chapel, ......you might end up with a pretty fairy tale-like story, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I don't think that story is so preposterous. ...It's a well-known fact that Father still loves {f:5:Beatrice} deeply. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"...Also, even though I said I found it creepy, I seem to remember that the interior of the chapel was quite magnificent. ......The thought that Father built this chapel in the hopes of having a wedding with his dead mistress...might not be that unlikely."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...By the time he built this chapel, Grandfather probably knew that he would never use it as a church as long as he lived. "
Ushiromiya George,"...But, he prayed for the witch to be revived by some miracle. And he thought that if that miracle occurred, they could be married here..."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...I see. ...If you think of it that way, this would be a place of utmost significance to {f:5:Beatrice}-sama as well... Even though he knew the chapel would never be opened. ...It's a story of tragic love."" "
,"Even though Gohda-san was even bigger than me, his words were touching. "
,"...Everyone was silent, but it seemed that they agreed with that view. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Even though he knew it was a chapel never to be opened, ...he still probably dreamed of the day that a miracle would occur. ......Kinzo-san was quite the romantic in his younger days. I think I understand how he felt."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ihihi. I wonder. ...Then again, everyone went in it four times a year to clean, right? "
Ushiromiya Battler,"So much for it being ""the sealed chapel"". Didn't we just go in ourselves? That wasn't a miracle or anything. We brought the key, click, and we're in. That's all. This is ridiculous."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........Huh? ......What?! .........Then, ......what does that mean?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wh-What are you talking about...?"" "
,"As far as I could tell, I'd just been joking around, finding myself a bit irritated by the sob story this was turning into. ...But then Aunt Rosa suddenly jumped on me, with a really serious face. "
,"Aunt Rosa's face grew increasingly pale. ...She looked at the magic circle on the door, and then at her hand, back and forth, back and forth. "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Wh-What is the matter, Rosa-sama...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Hey, Gohda-san! The key to this chapel! Didn't Genji-san say it? {i:He said there was only one}! "
Ushiromiya George,""".........Huh? ........."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. ...It took you all way too long to figure it out. Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."" "
,"...When a kid pulls a prank, it sometimes goes unnoticed by the adults, and the kid who did it gets all disappointed. "
,"...If such a prank then gets sprung on someone much later, it can really make a kid's day. "
,...Maria's celebration just now looked a lot like that... 
Gohda Toshiro,"""...U-Um, yes, that's right. There is only one of those keys. It's the key to the Master's treasured chapel, so there is only one, with no duplicates. ...It is normally kept safe in the key box in the servant room, but..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That's right. And Genji-san said it had gone missing. ...So, someone stole it, ...put it in an envelope, and handed it to Maria?! And they did it yesterday!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......What the...? So in other words, ......isn't that strange?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...That's absurd. ......This is getting bizarre."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Wh-What do you mean...? I don't have a clue what you're talking about..."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Me neither. ...Would you explain it for us...?"" "
,...Gohda and Nanjo's failure to understand definitely wasn't because they were stupid. 
,...They didn't know. ...They didn't know how long the only key to the chapel had been in Maria's possession. 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""There's no mistake! It was locked up!! I unlocked it!! There's no doubt!!"" "
,"Aunt Rosa kept closing the door, locking it, pulling on it to check the lock, and opening it again. "
,Her face was becoming pale again... 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Until I took the key out of Maria's envelope and opened this door, it was definitely locked!! But this key was in an envelope placed in Maria's care! And that happened yesterday before noon!!!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......What did you say......?"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""But that...doesn't make any sense...!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You're right. ......Maria received a one-of-a-kind key from a woman calling herself a witch midday yesterday. In other words, from midday yesterday until this morning, when Rosa-san unlocked the door, this chapel was a closed room."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......How did they get those six people in here, and then how did they kill them?!"" "
,"The deaths of six people had shaken us badly. When we learned about that weird magic circle and the history of the chapel, we felt as though we'd figured at least part of this puzzle out. "
,...But that was all absolutely trivial! 
,"From midday yesterday until this morning, this chapel was a closed room. But our parents were with us until last night. "
,How did the culprit get into this building?! And how did they lock it up again?! 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...What are you trying to pull? ...Again? A closed room again?! Are you trying to say you unlocked it with the power of magic?!! Don't take me for a fool!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If you're demanding that I show you how to open locks with my power, I wouldn't mind. ...But that wouldn't be the same as me forcing you to surrender."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You keep trying to ""explain it all with humans""! Only when I've cornered all your theories completely...will I have my victory!! Come now, how will you undermine my defenses? What trick could a human have used to defeat them, hmm?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's just like the closed rooms last time. ...Not enough information!! It's impossible to reason like this! Any excuse could be made, any trick could work!! There's no way to reason it out!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ha! That again? There's not enough information, so you'll wait and see? Your information is uncertain, so it's impossible to use your reasoning...? Ha, this is always the excuse you humans use to let yourselves stop thinking. Who do you think you are, lowly human?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Are you saying you can't even think unless you're like Laplace's demon, you incompetent fool?!! ...Besides, you make it seem like a lack of information works against you, but it's the other way around, you see?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The more information you're given, the more it will make you suffer! It'll only increase the strength of the compressor that's squeezing you! *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh, in that case, let me say this. It's impossible to verify that this is a closed room in the first place!! If we're already talking about demons, I can play that game too."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...It'd be possible to prove that this {i:isn't} a closed room. Just show how someone could've gone in or out, and you're done!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But it's impossible to prove that this {i:is} a closed room!! You could never deny the endless set of possible methods for getting in. In other words, this is one of those Devil's Proofs!! This concept of a closed room is actually something that can never be proved!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, first you stop thinking, with a lack of information as an excuse, and now this. ...Very well. If that is your move, then I will accept it. Continue."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""First off, it looks like you're trying to claim that the chapel's a closed room. ...Just a short while ago, I spent some time looking around in there, and I couldn't find any way in or out except for the door."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...But that {i:just means I couldn't find one}. It doesn't prove it was a closed room!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If there's a ""hidden door"" or something that I wasn't able to find, your premise would be blown away completely!! In other words, whether I managed to find a hidden door or not, you'll never be able to deny that there existed some method X that'd let you into the closed room!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""And this method X would be something that could be carried out without magic. After all, it's a ""hidden door""! I'm sure that in this chapel, there's some hidden door that's impossible to find. That's why there's no reason for me to reason it out, and magic is still impossible!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Hohoh, so you'll use that logic. *cackle*cackle* How naive. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"An expected move. Let me make my move in response. ...These ""closed rooms"" used in detective novels made by mere humans always seem utterly ridiculous to me."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Why? Because they're used the wrong way. ...When a closed room appears in a detective novel, do you really think it's a closed room? You don't, do you?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{i:What trick did they use to make this look like a closed room}?! That's what you think."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In other words, there hasn't been a completed closed room in the any of closed room murders that humans have built over the last century!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oooh!! Better not say that, unless you wanna face the wrath of the mystery fans! Christie's probably grinding her teeth in her grave!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hmph!! But I am different. I have given birth to a true closed room! And I can demonstrate it. Why? Because I am a witch!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""For the Devil's Proof, you only had to bring someone a demon to prove that they exist, correct? Well, I conveniently happen to be a witch, meaning that demons are my good friends, and I can bring you as many of them as you like!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sounds great!! ""Dad and the rest used a hidden door to enter the chapel or were carried in through it""! How do you plan to beat that move?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""With this. Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, ""the six definitely entered through the door""!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Huh?!?! Dumbass!! The door was locked, so how'd they do it?!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I opened it with magic and invited them inside!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That can't be true!! Since I can't accept magic, there's no way I'll accept that!! You're lying!! That door can be opened with some trick. Or maybe there's a hidden door, but I won't accept any other way!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Perpetual check!! That's what we call an endless repetition of moves in chess. It's the same endless repetition as a discussion that won't advance because both sides deny the basis of each other's claims, like our game. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"...In most games, this would be resolved as a draw, but that would put a terrible damper on our fun!! We will have no draws. You will either accept me and submit to me, or you will deny me!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""At least I agree with you there!! We'll settle this without fail, just as you wish!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*! I like that attitude! ......So, I had a thought. I think I'll add a new rule to this game between the two of us."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""A new rule?! ...I'll bet it's something that'll give you an advantage, right?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Of course not. I'll give you the thing people like you always demand. The reason you always stop thinking and then moan about it...is ""a lack of information""! And if you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by ""rejecting the source""!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Isn't that convenient? What clever little words to hide your own incompetence. I'm offering to eliminate that convenient excuse of yours. You should thank me, *cackle*!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You said they entered through the door, and I said that couldn't happen. ...Are you calling that an evasive answer?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Exactly. So from now on, {p:1:when I speak the truth, I will use red}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wh-What is this...?! Keep explaining!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No matter what magical move I use, you can always keep running away by chanting ""lack of information"" and by ""rejecting the source""."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Even though I would still win in the end that way, it would be extremely boring. ...Because of that, I'd be happy to I give you the ""information"" and ""sources"" you so desire."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However, you'll probably doubt each word I say. That isn't bad in itself. I also will use every possible move to make you submit. I don't dislike our posture of searching out our best moves for our own goals."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...But that won't make a game. So I set up this rule."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""" {p:1:Everything I speak in red is the truth}! There's absolutely no need to doubt it!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Are you telling me to believe that...?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""This is a game between you and me. In a game, the rules are sacred!! Those who take that lightly are not qualified to play!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Okay, I get you, I'll accept that rule!! Even an elementary school kid can get into an endless argument and find fault with everything. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Then let's start it up again, continuing where we left off. I'll say it one more time. ""Dad and the rest used a hidden door to enter the chapel or were carried in through it""!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Then I shall repeat what I said. ""{p:1:Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, the six definitely entered through the door}""!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........I‐is there any proof? "" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Stop! I will supplement the rule."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...When I speak the truth, I will use red, {i:and when I do, I will not bear the responsibility of establishing that claim by showing proof}! They will simply be facts and the truth!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""My reason is simple. I carried out all the crimes with magic. So for any impossible crime, all I have to do is wave my magic staff and show you how it's done."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""But that wouldn't make a game! It would be as barbaric as ignoring victory and defeat in a chess match and punching your opponent in the face!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...W-Well, that makes sense. ...Since you're a witch, {i:there's no need for you to show evidence for what happened}. ...Since you can do anything with magic, dammit... Talk about an unfair game...!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, shall we resume once more? The six definitely entered through the door. I unlocked it with magic. ...How will you get around this magic, this closed room?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Th-The key! Genji-san and the others said there was only one key, but that's impossible to prove! The culprit secretly made a duplicate key...!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! {p:1:Only one key to the chapel exists}!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Arg... Th-Then what about this. The culprit made something other than a legitimate key and opened it! I don't know what, but maybe a wire! A tool for picking locks!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What is this naive move? {p:1:It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with anything but the chapel's key}!! Although it can be opened with the power of magic, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then what about this!! There's something wrong with the door itself! There was some way to pass through it even while it was locked...! As to what that is, I can think of a few ways! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Maybe it's like those big doors on a castle that have a smaller door in them! It's also possible that they removed the hinges, and then removed the whole door before entering!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wahahahahahahahahahaha! Is {i:this} the best a century of human wisdom can manage, Battleeeeeeer?! {p:1:When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit}!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"Assuming you can't use magic, right...? *cackle*! Is it about time for checkmate?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Not even close!! You said those six people entered through a door, but you didn't say it was the front door! They might've entered through another door, a secret one!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You talk too much, you incompetent fool. Then let me expand on my earlier move. {p:1:The six definitely entered through {i:this front door}}!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's screwed up!! The door was locked, it was impossible to unlock without using that single key, and yet six people entered through it?!?! How?!! With magic, you say?! Damn it, dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wahahahahahahaaah!! Are we already seeing the limits of what humanity can manage?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Then shout that you resign!! When one admits defeat, it's customary to shout it out and knock over their own king. So, do you resign?! Then announce your surrender and knock your king over by kneeling!! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"Then you may kiss my shoes! There could be no greater joy than forcing a man like you to lick my shoes, *cackle*cackle*cackle*kakakakakakakaka!!"" "
,"......Damn iiiiiiiiit... It's useless, useless, useless... So I can't win against the witch...?! "
,"This isn't chess at all, I've just been made to take the losing side in a chess puzzle...! Is quibbling about details and getting a draw the best I can manage...? "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That's the one thing that'll never happen...! Either I will surrender, or you will!! There can be no other resolution!! What happened to that bravery you displayed when you said this would be torture for us both?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hey, hey, hey, what a disappointment, what a total let doooooown, wouldn't you say, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeer...????"" "
,"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit, what should I do, what should I do?!! I can see it, I can see the place where I'll face checkmate...!! "
,"Aaaaaaaaah, it's useless it's useless, all my hard-fought moves have been nothing more than me desperately moving my king around, running away from check. "
,"...No matter how many times I move, I can't escape from check. So even without waiting for the next several moves, I can see checkmate in my future!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit......!! "
,"......After a few more moves, ...I can see where I'll face...checkmate...? "
,............ 
,"...Don't give up, Ushiromiya Battler. If I can see myself getting closed in upon... "
,"...Then if I spin the chessboard around, ...I should be able to anticipate her next move, right...? "
,"Remember what Kyrie-san said... When you're thinking about something, then the closer you get to the very, very end, ...the easier it becomes to anticipate. "
,Spin it around. ...Spin the chessboard around...!! 
Ushiromiya Battler,""".................."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...What happened? You fell silent all of a sudden. Fear not. Surrender is but a momentary shame. After that, all that remains is the joy of entrusting your fate entirely to the hands of your new master... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! Come on, cry out in resignation. ......I can't hear you. Speak up and say it clearly."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Enough babbling. You're just refusing to listen. ...So I'll say it once more. ...I won't resign. ...Continue. Resume the game."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Hoh. Very well. It is your turn, after all. ...*cackle*cackle*"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I made the mistake of thinking this rule you made was your own weapon. ...However, I've realized that it can also become a weapon for me. ......It all comes down to this."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Please do give it a try."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I've been focusing all this time on how they entered the closed room of the chapel... ......That approach was useless. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"...Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless. ...Spin the chessboard around."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......That's right. I was thinking about it backwards. ...This is how I should approach it. ......How was the chapel, which wasn't a closed room in the first place, made to look like a closed room?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Here it comes. ...That thinking technique humans gave birth to over the course of a century. Give it a try, *cackle*cackle*!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Say this in red for me. If you can't, then refuse. ...Here I go."" "
,...Does this man...intend to reverse his defensive posture? Impudence... 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I get that the only way to enter the chapel is through the door...and that there's only one key. ...But wait. ...The question is whether that key really was handed over to Maria yesterday before noon."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......My, but you're dragging this on. Do try and get to the point."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's something like this. ...We've been under the impression that the key's been unusable since midday yesterday. So, we've assumed that this was a closed room from midday yesterday until this morning!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I want to hear you say that this impression of ours is a solid fact."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Interesting. ...So you turn your reasoning not to the door, but to the key."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yesterday, Maria received an envelope from you. She didn't open it, but she might've felt it and known there was key inside. ...But it's not like she'd have been able to confirm absolutely that it was the key to the chapel."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Here's what I'm getting at: ...the thing inside the envelope given to Maria was a fake."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...If you think about what you're saying, it's ridiculous. {p:1:This morning, Rosa definitely took an envelope out of Maria's handbag,} {p:1:and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel}. ...It wasn't a fake, as you suggest."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heheh... I know that much. I'll continue. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"...In that case, when Maria first received the envelope, the thing inside it was definitely that same key to the chapel, right?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............ ......Hoh."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""See what I'm getting at? ...Midday yesterday, you gave Maria an envelope with a key inside. And you told her that she mustn't open it. ......Maria probably realized it had a key inside."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Later on, Aunt Rosa used the thing inside the envelope to open the door to the chapel, {i:and that's why we assumed it was the key to the chapel all along}. This is the suspicious part!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........So is this what you're trying to say? That when I entrusted Maria with a key, that key was a fake? And then, by the time Rosa obtained it, it had been switched with the real thing...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, that's it. ...What's wrong, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama? You've been looking a bit pale for a while now, huh...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Those close to me sometimes call me {ruby:bay-ah-tow:Beato}. Beato will do."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's your turn, Beato. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"The Turn of the Golden Witch! ...Let's see you dodge this."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Very well. ...{p:1:The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'll move forward. ...Can you repeat it in red? ...""That envelope was completely under Maria's supervision until Aunt Rosa opened it""."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...If you can't say it, then say you refuse. Check."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Nng, .........I refuse."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I've spun it all around with just one move. ...Now it's your king on the run, Beato."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Hmph, I have a reason for refusing. It regards the definition of the phrase ""under her supervision"". ...In its purest meaning, Maria would need to have her eyes on it around the clock for that to be true."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...But Maria didn't go that far. It may have been completely under her supervision when she took it out of her handbag, but after she put it inside, it disappeared from her field of vision. In that sense, the phrase ""under her supervision"" would be inappropriate, so I couldn't use the red, nothing more. ............Nng..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I'll bet that move hurt. And your face tells me you've guessed the next one. "
Ushiromiya Battler,.........Sorry. I'm kind to women. I don't hurt them. {i:And I never betray a woman's expectations}! 
Ushiromiya Battler,"......It's time for you to repeat it in red, if you think you can. ""No one was able to touch Maria's handbag until Aunt Rosa took out the envelope""."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........I will also...refuse this one. ...I won't explain the reason."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's wrong. ...It's not that you won't explain it, it's that you can't explain it. ......That move gives us checkmate, doesn't it...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............Nng..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If you can't do it, then I'll explain. ......The key to the chapel really was in the envelope you handed to Maria. ...Then Maria put it in her handbag, and the next morning, Aunt Rosa took it out and opened the lock."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......However! Maria didn't have the handbag under her complete supervision! There's no need for magic. It's a closed room trick that's possible for a human!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The Human culprit handed Maria the key, and by making Aunt Rosa use it the next morning, they created the illusion that there was a closed room during that time."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You can't deny the possibility that during that time, the culprit took the key from Maria's handbag, used it, and returned it by morning!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Can you say it in red?! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Repeat it! If you can say it, then say it!! It's check again!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...N-Not yet. I remove the check... ...The envelope with the key in it should have been sealed with wax...! Rosa took it from an unopened envelope..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Really? Then try saying it!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Repeat it!! ""The envelope handed over midday yesterday and one Aunt Rosa opened are the same thing""."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Th-That I can repeat. {p:1:The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing}!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Hah...! ...Aaaaah, it's useless, it's all useless. That doesn't even matter anymore. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"...I expected more from you. ...I figured that if you were a bit better at reading between the lines, you'd resign right there. ...So I'm disappointed. ......{i:You've betrayed my expectations}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Wh-Wha...aat......!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Who cares if the envelopes were the same? ...Envelopes can be sealed with wax over and over! The key inside is what's important."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Nngg, .........nnnnnnggg......"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""This time, it's all over, Golden Witch. It's a real checkmate. ...I'll say it one more time, repeat it!! If you can say it, try saying it!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""""The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Aunt Rosa opened the envelope""!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................h... ......Nnggg, ......how... ......! How...... c- could I... ...Against a lowly human......!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'll keep on saying it, {f:5:Beatrice}!!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Repeat it!! ""The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Aunt Rosa opened the envelope""!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Nnngaaah, ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If you're gonna yell, then say you resign! This settles it!! This is the truth."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Before Aunt Rosa obtained Maria's key this morning, at one point, it passed to someone else's hands."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then they used it, resealed it, and returned it to Maria's handbag, making it look like it hadn't been used!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""This is a trick with a cheap loophole, the assumption that the key wasn't used because the sealing wax wasn't opened!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Checkmate!! There's no magic, and it's nothing more than a trick that's possible for humans!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I-In that case, ...who do you say stole the key?! Try answering! This time, you try repeating it...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's right, I'm making you repeat things all the time. I probably have to answer every once in a while..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{i:But I refuse}!! My condition for victory is denying a witch's existence. I'll prove that this impossible crime done with your magic was actually possible by human hands!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I've smashed your closed room with something possible even for humans. However, I won't specifically investigate who the culprit is."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Because I believe in humans!! Because I definitely won't accept that there's a person among us who would steal the key from Maria, use it, and do something so horrible!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Heh, hehehehehhahahahahahahaha!!! I give up, I resign! Just once, for this skirmish, I'll give up. ...But, you really are naive, Battler."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Parting remarks are a loser's privilege. Say as many as you like."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Nngg...! Since you continue to deny my existence, you will eventually be cornered..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""After all, since you deny me, you will have to suspect those relatives that you can't stop loving...! In the last moment, when you have to suspect one who is beloved to you, then you will surely accept my existence...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle* True, you have defeated me in this skirmish alone. ...However, that naive logic will definitely destroy you... ...You can't win against me after all!! Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"" "
