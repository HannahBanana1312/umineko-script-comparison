,"I became the Halloween party princess, and the tournament of quizzes and riddles just for me began. "
,It looks like I get a medal for each puzzle I get right. 
,"If I get a lot, I'm supposed to get a wonderful prize from Grandfather. "
,"Okay, here I go. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Who should I start with?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I don't think it matters. Start with whomever you like."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I'd better think up a killer puzzle while I have the chance."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Maria, didn't you have a quiz book in your bag?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-! I do! Kihihihihihi, I'm gonna give Ange a nasty one...!"" "
,Maria onee-chan laughed with an evil smile. 
,Looks like everyone's going to try and bully me. I'm sure they'll think up some really hard questions. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Don't worry, I'll lend a hand."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Really...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Of course. After all, I'm the princess's attendant. So, let's give it our all together and get a huge pile of medals."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay...!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Come now, Ange-sama. Start wherever you want. I, Gohda, am ready to challenge you whenever you please."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Whoa, not so fast. The honor of the first audience with the princess belongs to me. Ange, begin with my challenge...!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""O-Okay!"" "
,"I suddenly got tense, and my stomach began to feel tight. "
,"Then, Aunt Eva gently held my hand. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It'll be okay. Let's do this together!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...O-Okay!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Then let us begin, Ange. This is a story about December 25th, Christmas Day."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Christmas...?"" "
,"Even though it was October, he suddenly started talking about Christmas. Is he going to ask what day Christmas is? "
,I know that. It's December 25th. 
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""On Christmas Day, a woman looked up at the night sky and spoke: ""Eventually, the night will end, and morning will come. Wouldn't it be wonderful if, after the sun sinks and it becomes night once more, it could be Christmas again?"" And then, the man spoke. ""Okay, I'll make your dream come true for you."" Is such a thing possible...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The day after Christmas is the 26th, a normal day. That's impossible."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Still Christmas, even after the sun rises... Oh, I've got it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? How?! How can the day after Christmas be Christmas again?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahahahaha. Think about it for yourself, Ange."" "
