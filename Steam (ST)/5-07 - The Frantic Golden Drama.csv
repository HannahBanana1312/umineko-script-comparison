Speaker,Steam (ST)
,*knock*knock*knock*knock*!!! 
,The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses. 
,She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day. 
,But...what could it be...? At a time like this... 
,"More importantly, the knock itself was strange. "
,"If someone wanted to contact her, they could've just used the internal phone line. "
,She'd told them that she'd be here. 
,"Realizing that something strange was going on, Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Father, Father...!! It's Eva. I have an urgent, vital matter to discuss with you!"" "
,It was Eva's voice. 
,...What is this? 
,I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse. 
,So why is Eva here...?! 
,"Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice. "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......What is it? You're too noisy!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Natsuhi nee-san...?! Why are you in Father's study at this hour?!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...I told you to be quiet! Have you forgotten that the Head values peace and silence more than anything else...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Now's not the time to be saying that!! Stop harping on that, and open up quickly!! Bring Father out!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""The Head just went to sleep! I don't know what business you have, but I will deal with it tomorrow!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I don't have any business with you!! Just open up right now!!"" "
,"Sometimes, multiple schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies. "
,This is bad... 
,"If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study. "
,"Now, I can't even open this door...! "
,"At that moment, the phone suddenly rang. "
,I-It's okay. Both of the keys to the study are here. 
,No one can open this door...! 
,Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver... 
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""H-Hello!! It's Natsuhi!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""It's me... Things are bad. I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly."" "
,It was from Krauss. His tone was strained. 
,...What in the world happened...?! 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""It would seem that Battler-kun and this guest called Erika... ...solved the witch's epitaph and found the gold."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Huh? ............ ...I-Is that true?!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in. They're saying Battler-kun will show everyone the way to the hidden gold..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Right now, Eva-san is just outside the study door, yelling at me to open it...! But if I do that now, she might push her way inside...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...I-I understand. I will go there too. Don't worry about Eva. Just stay there and don't do anything...! I'll give you a signal once I've gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that. Ready...?!"" "
,"Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji. "
,"A heated debate started between him and Eva. ""Open up!"" ""No, calm down."" "
,"In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal. "
,...Krauss had cleverly pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her. 
,"During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door... "
,"Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment, but the heavy sound of the auto-lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The gold of the epitaph has been found! It's only natural that we should inform Father about this...!! Or else what? Is there some reason you can't tell Father about this?!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Father gave strict orders that he not be awakened—no matter what—after he went to bed. Following those orders is the duty of the Head's representative. Isn't that right, Genji-san?"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""......Yes. The Master's sleep must not be disturbed, no matter what happens."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Even a rule like that depends on time and circumstances, doesn't it...?!! I mean, the epitaph was solved!! Father has a right to know straight away!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the Head tomorrow. That's our duty as the Head's representatives."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I don't care about that!! Come on, just open this door!! Let me see Father!! Father, Father, can you hear me? It's Eva!! Please open up!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Owowow, let go of me...!! Th-That hurts...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""We're telling you to listen to us...! Don't knock on the door so loudly...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ouch, owowowowow...!! Let go, let go of me!!"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""Krauss-sama, Eva-sama, the Master is sleeping. Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!"" "
,"When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle. "
,"It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva... "
,Eva put her argument aside for the time being. 
,"She could hold off worrying about that until after she saw the gold with her own eyes. After all, not even Eva had seen it for herself yet. "
,Natsuhi and the others had managed to somehow deal with the momentary crisis. 
,"...However, the move of the demons that would sneer upon their efforts...had already begun... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Battler......solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Yes. ...Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer. Erika has proclaimed that she will abandon her rights to the Golden Land. ...Therefore, the one who reached the Golden Land...is Battler."" "
Ronove,"""......Fate can be truly amusing. To think that Battler-sama...would make it there."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""What will you do, Beato? ...You promised to stop the ceremony if anyone solved the epitaph's riddle."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Yes. ...That was the deal."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............That was the deal. Indeed..."" "
Ronove,"""Apparently, Battler-sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land. ...It now seems that no one will become our master."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""That is also fate. It has been several decades since we first manifested in the Human world through our bond with Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}. ...The time since then has been so very fun."" "
Gaap,"""......Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady. ...So, what're we going to do? If we go by Riiche and {f:5:Goldsmith}'s rules, now that Battler's solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master, we've been relieved from duty, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""That's true. ...I have no regrets at all. I've been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wait. We can't let that happen. ...You might not have any regrets, but I will keep on serving Natsuhi. It would be quite irresponsible to let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph. ...Witches are forbidden from breaking contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude."" "
Ronove,"""...True. We should serve her until the family conference ends."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""In that case, you won't be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}. ...Perhaps you should wait until you've overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi-sama at the very least, ...and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........Indeed. ...She has done well supporting my foolish son."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You're a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off, aren't you? Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Indeed. ...Perhaps that would be fitting. Natsuhi may be worthy of bearing my wing. ...However, ......we are approaching the critical moment. ...Your reward is waiting for you. Try to make it through this test unscathed, ...Natsuhi..."" "
,The mountain of gold left everyone speechless. 
,"Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence, ...no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked... "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......To think a place like this existed......"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I can't believe it... ...That Dad......"" "
,Everyone was stunned by the gold. 
,The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi. 
,"Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold. Then he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""W-Wahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!! Th-This is incredible! It's the real thing!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......H-Hahahahahahaha!! That damn Dad of ours, sticking this much gold in such a ridiculous place!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Now that we have this much, ...we no longer... have anything to fear... With this, ...we could overcome any kind of trial...! Rosaaa...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Nee-san, ...Nee-san... We'll be able to find happiness with this, right...?"" "
,Eva and Rosa moved towards each other at the same time and hugged as they broke down crying... 
,"Ecstasy and shock, ...wonder and sighs. "
,"After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that had caused these mixed emotions, ...Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show. "
Furudo Erika,"""......If this world is money, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness. ...Congratulations, everyone. I pray that this discovery makes all of your lives richer."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I take my hat off to you... ...To think you'd solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......If you couldn't solve it in a single day, then you wouldn't be able to solve it no matter how many days you had. After all, it doesn't take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition. ...Also, I wouldn't have been able to solve this riddle myself. I ask that you praise Battler-san's achievement as well, everyone."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..............."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...I abandon any rights to this discovery. I'm already satisfied to have my reasoning proven correct. So, I'd like give Battler-san full credit."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I wasn't. Battler-san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of the cousins would notice. That can only mean one thing. ...He must have wanted to begin the true family conference with all of you."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Erika, quit deciding things on your own."" "
Furudo Erika,"""My apologies. .........In that case, I'll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings. So, who will take my place?"" "
,"Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone. "
,"...After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""None of us have forgotten the deal we made earlier today, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Yeah. Divide it between the four of us, with 2.5 billion for each. And then, {i:the Successor} gets another 10 billion."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......W-Wait a second! Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the Successor?!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Hold up, you won't be able to get away with that, Natsuhi-san...!! We've all been arguing based on that premise this whole time, haven't we?! You really think you can pretend that never happened now?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...That's right. ...Weren't you the one worrying about how, if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the Successor...?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""But nowhere is it explicitly written that that's the truth, right?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You bastard!!! We were all aware of it, weren't we?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""That's right, Aniki! Are you gonna change your position this late in the game?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Though it was never stipulated, I believe it was common knowledge between us. I don't see how you can suggest we ignore it completely."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""You can't just interpret the Head's epitaph however you like!! Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the Successor?! The epitaph was decided upon by the Head. You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Calm down, Natsuhi."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""How could I calm down?! Yes, I do find it quite impressive that Battler-kun solved the epitaph! I certainly believe he should be rewarded for it. However, it's clearly a stretch to suggest that he deserves half of everything, and you won't get away with the argument that the discoverer becomes the Successor...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Th-That's low, Natsuhi nee-san...! This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I agree! Though it was never stipulated, the fact that whoever solves the epitaph becomes the Successor has always been the greatest unwritten rule we've had...! It's not fair if you start complaining about that at the last second, right? Yeah, it isn't fair!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Anyway!! This gold is Father's!! We can't decide how it will be split up without Father's permission!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""No way!! That's low, Natsuhi-san! We were talkin' about this on and on earlier, right?! Are you sayin' that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?! It just ain't right!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Why don't we just vote on it?!! Battler-kun, the one who found the gold, is the Successor! My husband and I have no objections!! What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie-san? Rosa?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I have no objections either. Battler-kun is the true Successor, chosen by the epitaph. If you aren't satisfied, then why don't we just ask Father directly...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's right. Like you just said, Natsuhi nee-san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph. And he's also the proper owner of this gold. In that case, shouldn't we talk to Father about this directly? How should Battler-kun, the person who discovered the gold, be treated? I believe Father is the only one capable of making such a decision...!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""B-But...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Didn't I tell you to calm down? ........."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Rosa and Kyrie-san are right. Let's ask Father!! Your turn is already over, Nii-san, Natsuhi nee-san!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Yeah, yeah!! Bring Father out to us!! We won't get anywhere with just you two! Let's begin the real family conference!! Does this look like something you can put off just because he's tired?! If we take this thing lightly, we'll have a massive problem on our hands...! "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"Hey, are you listening?!! We won't get anywhere with just you!! Bring Father out right noooooow!!!"" "
Furudo Erika,""".........Are family conferences always like this?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...How the hell'd I know?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""They're probably always like this on the inside. ......Heheheheh. Looks like they won't be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo-san. "
Furudo Erika,"...To think he's being called out to settle his children's fight, even though it's been announced that he has only a short while to live. ...I wonder how he feels right about now. *giggle* Imagining that...no, reasoning that out will be a treat."" "
,"The parents ignored Battler and Erika...and kept yelling at each other, on and on... "
,"Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he'd seen it. "
,"He'd suspected it since six years ago, and he'd been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like by the darkening expressions on his parents' faces when this time of year drew near... "
,"However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes... ...was much more... ...ugly than he'd imagined... "
,That's why he was very glad that he'd called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything... 
,"Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break. "
,It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion... 
,"This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, but there was no heating, and it was a little cold. "
,It wasn't well suited for a long conversation. 
,"They thought of the possibility that someone might snatch the gold away while their backs were turned, but of course, no one could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when it's 10 tons of gold they're dealing with. "
,"In fact, it might be said that having this mountain of gold in the background was actually robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions. "
,"So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more cold-bloodedly... "
Furudo Erika,"""...Then, if you would excuse me for the night. ...I imagine I'd just get in the way if I remained any longer."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sure, sorry. Did we bother you too much?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Let us show our gratitude again tomorrow. Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You said that you refused, but allow us to prepare a fitting portion, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold. Right, Nii-san?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Yes. We know what you're capable of. I think you can grasp our current circumstances."" "
,20 billion yen in gold isn't something they wanted out in the open. 
,They didn't want an outsider like Erika telling people about it. 
,"Of course, Erika had already ""reasoned out"" that much. "
,"She wore an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she understood all too well... "
Furudo Erika,"""...You don't need to worry about me. Of course, I have no desire to tell anyone else about this. ...And if I did, no one would believe me without proof."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......I got to see something interesting tonight. It was quite a spectacle, so I'm more than satisfied."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Heheh, I see. I guess it's not every day you see 10 tons of gold."" "
,"...Seeing the gold was the spectacle? Of course not. Judging by Erika's dark nature, it's obvious what she's so happy about. "
,"I thought about telling her to just go away, but even I wanted to get out of this place... "
,"I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika. However, Kyrie-san grabbed my shoulder. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You can't go, Battler-kun. Please come with us."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Yes, yes. You're now a real Successor! You've gotta have an audience with Father and have him acknowledge you right away...!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That's something only the Family Head may decide!! Don't make things up on your own!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Battler, I realize it'll be a pain, but stick around with us for a bit longer. Don't say anything. Just stay quiet and keep your head down. Got it?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Just do whatever you want."" "
,It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being the Successor. 
,...But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire. 
,"Even if I hadn't been ordered to keep quiet, staying shut up like a clam was clearly a good idea... "
,"In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...? "
,"Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him it was uncomfortable and to let go. "
,"However, he didn't pay attention to a word I said... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I've solved the epitaph. Just like you wanted."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""When you were the Game Master, we'd always get those letters. ...""Try and solve the epitaph"". ""If you don't, I'll kill you all""."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
,......Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph? 
,"By solving it, we found a mountain of gold. Yippee for us. "
,And what about Beato? 
,...Does she gain anything...by having us find the gold? 
,Or does she lose something...? 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ...people don't ever make moves that cause them to lose something. That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""No. {p:1:This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Are you sure that's okay? ...Using red like that without her permission."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...This child most likely wishes for it."" "
,"{f:5:Virgilia}, who had suddenly appeared there, quickly gave an answer to my question with the red truth... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""In the past, I sometimes guessed that Beato tried to make us solve the epitaph... because she wanted to make us find the gold's hiding place for her, so she could snatch it away. ......Is that wrong too?"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Yes. ...In the first place, {p:1:the gold of the Golden Land belongs to her from the start}. {p:1:She has absolutely no need to make anyone find it for her or to snatch it away herself}."" "
,Of course. ...Beato is {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden. 
,Isn't she the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist? ...That totally makes sense. 
,"However, that makes me even more confused. "
,"...Even if someone exposed the answer to the epitaph's riddle, Beato has nothing to gain. "
,"No, to the contrary, her own gold might be stolen away. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""In that case, I'm understanding this less and less. ......I understand the epitaph murders. It might be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ceremony to revive her powers as a witch. ...After all, she's probably doing it because of some reason or goal of her own."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But what's the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph? Whether we solve it or not, she has nothing to gain at all. ...In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not...is immaterial in Beato's eyes."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...You're right. {p:1:Whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, she has nothing at all to gain from it}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It doesn't matter whether it's solved or not. ...In other words, could we say that the epitaph's riddle itself is immaterial to Beato...?"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""............ ...You're right. The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child. So even if you take it to an extreme and call the epitaph's riddle immaterial, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
,Beato... 
,...Why are you making us solve the epitaph's riddle...? 
,"If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate... "
,And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate. 
,"After all, she's saying she'll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved. "
,"...In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle are worth the same to Beato. "
,Like two sides on a balanced scale. 
,That means that both the epitaph's riddle and massacring all the relatives... are equally significant from Beato's point of view...... 
,But {f:5:Virgilia} responded with the red truth. 
,"{p:1:Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain}. "
,"If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph's riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato. "
,"In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph's riddle in value, ...worth to her...? "
,"...Think, don't stop thinking... "
,The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth. 
,"As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato's goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped, a way that she decided on herself, both are worth the same thing to her. "
,"X=Y. And whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain. Y=0. So, in this case, ...what is X...? "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Wait a sec. ...That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Every time she performs these bizarre serial murders, she's willing to spend an incredible amount of effort to politely send advance notice... and then kills us one by one in accordance with the epitaph, never getting exposed. So all of that is meaningless to her...?"" "
,I spun the chessboard around and searched through Beato's moves over and over. This is always the first place I stumble. 
,The significance of the epitaph murders. 
,Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch's epitaph? 
,"If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it'd be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner... or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. "
,"However, on the first evening, Beato sent us a letter that sounded like an advance notice... and then carried out a three-part serial murder with large gaps in between: the six people of the first twilight, the two people of the second twilight, and the five people of the fourth and later twilights. "
,We aren't fools. 
,"Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders. "
,"Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other's alibis. "
,"As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically, and Beato's chances of success in this serial murder drop closer and closer to zero... "
,"All the epitaph murders...are like she's strangling her own neck, making it harder to succeed in this serial murder she's attempting. ...All for a useless embellishment, ...all just for show. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......She's raising the difficulty of completing her own objective."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""That does follow. ...She really is a strange child."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Did you know? In mystery novels, they call things like these epitaph murders ""plotline murders"". ...I think you can split the possible motives for plotline murders like this into three groups."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...And what are those?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Well, first off, maybe following the epitaph gives rise to misconceptions about evidence and alibis, which might benefit the culprit. ...Pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims would fit this pattern, as would committing murders that don't actually follow the epitaph, giving yourself an alibi by getting people to incorrectly guess the order of events."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""I see. So perhaps she only made it look as though she was killing them in a ceremonial fashion, following the epitaph, ...when she was actually guiding their thinking in a manner that benefited her. I do find that intriguing."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red. ...While she might've confused people in the world of the game board, she can't confuse us up here like that. ...In other words, the most obvious possible goal for her...isn't the real one."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""In that case, what are the other two possible reasons for carrying out plotline murders?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Another one is coincidence. ...A crime just happens to resemble the epitaph, without anyone in particular trying to make it do so, and the witnesses mistakenly think it's a plotline murder. Humans try to find cause and effect in everything they see. ...If we think we know what something is, then that's how it looks to us."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...I see. That's intriguing too. ...But would that really work? In this child's games, advance notice of the crime is always given before the murders of the first twilight. Also, I believe you've repeatedly found letters and circumstantial evidence that clearly show that the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, that's right. ......It isn't coincidence. From the very beginning, Beato's been advancing with the goal of making this look like a series of epitaph murders. We weren't mistaken about that. These are clear ""plotline murders"". So, this motive—or lack of motive—doesn't work either."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""In that case, ...there's only one motive left, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The last one......is because they want to show someone something. More specifically, fear. ...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue. The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they're certain will continue."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""In other words, ...this child performed these epitaph murders to make someone feel the fear of death?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Or at least, ...that'd explain things pretty well. ...The grotesque mutilation of corpses and the dark decorations were all a show to terrify us..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""To terrify whom...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Huh? ...Well, like I said, us. ............"" "
,"After hearing that one line {f:5:Virgilia} spoke so casually, ...my thoughts clouded over once again... "
,"Is it really sufficient to use the vague word ""us""...? "
,There are many humans in the Ushiromiya family. 
,"There's the Head and the one who holds the rank of his Successor, ...Grandfather and Uncle Krauss. "
,"There's the relatives, who have some pull in the business world. "
,"...On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year, and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty that day. "
,"...Even if the culprit hates all of us, ...there should be clear differences in how much they hate some of us compared to others. "
,"So, it should be possible to pick out people among us that the culprit especially wanted to terrorize or have revenge against. "
,If we liken this to a kid eating dessert... 
,Isn't the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last? 
,"No one tells you that you shouldn't eat it first, but our mentality encourages us to save it for later. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end. ...Yeah, like that line by my favorite character in this novel I like. Something about how the worst way to kill someone is to 'murder those close to them first, make them as miserable as possible, and only kill the person then'."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel. How frightening..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most. ...However, every single time, the order people get killed changes around completely. ...If we try counting up the people who live until the last twilight every single time, even though they do die in the end, ......... ............"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
,...I'm the only one. 
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Let me first speak with the red. {p:1:Battler‐kun, you are not the culprit}. {p:1:You haven't killed anyone}. {p:1:This can be said of all games}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then that......just makes it even more likely that it's me. ...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show them to me."" "
,"Every time, Beato brags that she'll choose whom to kill next with a roulette. "
,"However, I'm the only one she never kills. ...Though she does kill me in the end, she leaves me be until the very last moment. "
,"In all of these supposedly random games, there's only this one unchanging constant... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""She wants......revenge? Against me? So, is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""That's wrong. ......{p:1:Her goal is not to make someone experience fear}. {p:1:And it isn't to have revenge on someone either}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""In that case, the epitaph murders really don't mean anything to her! The epitaph's riddle is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless. X=Y=0! But even so, she's clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What could she want from me...that'd be worth the same to her as something meaningless?! ...I don't get it!! The more I think about it, the less I understand what she's thinking!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..............."" "
,"{f:5:Beatrice}, the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless string of serial murders. "
,"Even the epitaph's riddle, which that witch used as the trigger that could suspend the serial murders, ...is meaningless, immaterial. "
,"And yet...she's thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face. "
,"...What is it...that you want from me...? ...Or else, what is it that you're giving me...? "
,My idea that Beato has clearly been taking revenge on me...has already been denied by {f:5:Virgilia}'s red truth. 
,Both X and Y. Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle hold no meaning for {f:5:Beatrice}. 
,X=Y=0. 
,"However, since she's thrusting those things in front of me, ...they must... ...have some meaning. "
,"She showed us the scales representing ""if you don't solve the epitaph, I'll carry out the epitaph murders"". "
,"In other words, neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph's riddle have any significance by themselves. "
,"However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and puts them on display before us......no, before me. "
,"...In other words, it should be like this: "
,X=0. Y=0. X+Y>0. 
,"A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides. However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...It's almost like...playing. Like kids playing rock, paper, scissors."" "
,"Rock, paper, scissors is an extremely familiar method of randomly determining a winner and loser. "
,"You sometimes wager some sort of reward on the outcome, ...but kids often do rock, paper, scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular. "
,"Unless you bet something, you have nothing to gain or lose except happiness and frustration. "
,"In other words, the two sides of the scale, both winning and losing, are immaterial. "
,"However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip... is the reason kids play rock, paper, scissors. "
,"After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game, ...and they aren't purely interested in the value of winning or losing. "
,They aren't overly concerned about who wins and who loses... 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That would mean it doesn't matter to Beato...whether the epitaph murders succeed or not. ...It almost feels like she's just enjoying the process."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...In the past, ...I cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason. ...But right now, I can't imagine that's true."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Thank you. In that case, I'll give you one more line of red. ...{p:1:Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure}."" "
,"She didn't do it for pleasure, and she didn't do it to make anyone feel fear. "
,"Since she has nothing to gain, she doesn't care whether the epitaph murders succeed or fail. "
,It's almost like...a random game kids would play... 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's not right. ...It does have meaning. It has meaning for her."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......And what is...this meaning...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I don't get it. Even though both sides of the scale are immaterial, ...the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes."" "
,...Of course it isn't meaningless. Some meaning definitely exists. 
,"In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago. "
,...Am I supposed to believe that was meaningless too? 
,No. That definitely isn't the case. 
,I clearly remember the serious gaze Beato had back then. 
,"Unfortunately, I didn't have a clue what she meant. ...When she saw that, she was horribly dejected. "
,That's right. 
,"At that time, I'm sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn't have occurred if I hadn't come. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It does have meaning. ......It means something to her. And it's connected to something she wants from me."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""....................."" "
,"I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head, ...then patted her head. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest you just write ""I love you"". ...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......*giggle*."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I still don't have a clue what she's thinking. ...Even so, I won't stop thinking. ...I've only just started spinning the chessboard around. ...I definitely won't give up...on this journey in search of your thoughts."" "
