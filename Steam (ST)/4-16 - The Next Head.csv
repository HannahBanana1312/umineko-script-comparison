Speaker,Steam (ST)
,"Of course, since the time of her birth, ...Jessica had been raised in this mansion. "
,"The atrophied, Western-style house that the cousins called a mansion was her home. "
,"And yet, she had never understood her cousins' feelings as much as she did today. "
,"...At the same time, she had never felt her own home, which she knew well, to be as alien as it seemed now... "
,Her own......room. 
,"This had once been her hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace. "
,"However, ...she had never felt as much pressure coming from that door as she did now. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......A test, you say...? Tch, what the hell could be waiting in there... I'm not gonna find my desk and stuff dragged around all over the place, right...?"" "
,"She acted tough, trying to deceive herself. ...Trying make herself believe that she wasn't scared of anything. "
,"Readying herself, she opened the door to her room. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""............"" "
,"...When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn't appear to be messed up, she relaxed. "
,No one...was there. ...Of course. There was nowhere for anyone to hide here. 
,"Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her. ...This way, the room was safe. "
,"She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Wh-What the hell. ...Haha, ...haha...!"" "
,She looked at the clock. ...It was just past 23:10. 
,"As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been. "
,It was still about 23:00. 
,"...The plan had been for all the cousins to gather, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about various things together into the night. "
,"Normally, we would've been doing that kind of thing right now. Why...has that turned into this...? "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......It's all that damn geezer's fault... ...How could he do that...to Mom... to everyone......"" "
,She shook her head back and forth with anger and sadness... But there was no one here to direct those emotions at. 
,"...Because of the lock, this room's security was guaranteed. Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm... "
,If it keeps up like this and nothing happens... ...I want to go to the dining hall and see Mom's dead face. 
,"...Even though Gohda emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that I definitely shouldn't go to look at it, even so, I wanted to see her face at the end... "
,But we were warned repeatedly that stepping out of line even a little would put the hostages in danger. 
,...Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules...? 
,"If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved. "
,"...But if I don't open it, it'll surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon-kun, Shannon, Aunt Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo... will be killed. "
,......There's no way the scales will balance out between five lives and my own one life. 
,"Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself that said ""Isn't it okay as long as I stay alive?"", ...faced the door, and made to unlock it. "
,...At that time. 
,*clap* *clap* *clap*... 
,"A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica's heart leap... "
Ronove,"""If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages. ...But despite that, your own life might be saved."" "
Ronove,"""However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself. That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Wh-Who......"" "
,"I, the owner of this room, ...searched everywhere a human could've been hiding, ......where did this man...come from...? "
,"......There was nowhere for a Human to hide, ...but could something non-Human have managed it......? "
,"This was supposedly my first meeting with this largely-built, middle-aged man. ...I didn't recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the crest of the One-Winged Eagle. "
Ronove,"""A pleasure to meet you, Jessica-sama. ......I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72. I am called Ronove."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Rono...ue...? ......Genji...san......?"" "
Ronove,"""...Ah yes, ...Genji is like my little brother. Or perhaps he was my true form while in this world. ...You might even say he was my vessel."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......What's...this guy...saying......?"" "
Ronove,"""Oh, my apologies. This is not something a Human would be able to understand. ......Well then, let us move on to the main event."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""So this is... ...that test or whatever the damn geezer talked about......?"" "
Ronove,"""Correct. This is the test that the Master has granted you, Jessica-sama."" "
,"At Ronove's elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for a meal to be set out, many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Gwah?! What the...hell...?!"" "
,"As the cloud of gold butterflies spun around in a small swirl, they gathered in one place. "
,"...Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind, ...and there lay a Western envelope with the One-Winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf... "
,"With a gesture, Ronove urged her to pick it up. Jessica timidly did so...and opened the letter inside... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,""".........What's...this...?"" "
Ronove,"""It is an exceedingly simple test to determine whether one is qualified to become the Successor. ...Please attend to the question written there with a fitting attitude for the Successor who is to support the Ushiromiya family... and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,""".........D-Dumbass......"" "
,"Shaking, Jessica looked between the paper and Ronove's face several times... "
,"...At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden. "
,"If things had gone normally, ...he had planned to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, at this time, on this day. "
,...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon. 
Gaap,"""...Read it. That is {f:5:Goldsmith}'s test for you."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""............"" "
,"George picked up the Western envelope, which was on the table where he'd once had tea with Shannon, and read its contents... "
,"Perhaps its message was short. After glancing at it, George's eyes grew sharp. "
Ushiromiya George,"""......What's this supposed to be?"" "
Gaap,"""Ehheheheheh. ...It is as you see. This is the test given to you, to see if you're qualified to be the Successor. ...As you ask yourself whether you truly are so qualified, answer that question."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......What a...stupid question."" "
Gaap,"""That's right. It really is a stupid question. ......Doesn't that mean the Ushiromiya family inheritance is also something on that level in {f:5:Goldsmith}'s eyes? ...Heheheh."" "
,"George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, examining its contents... "
,"George and Jessica. ...While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same. "
Ushiromiya George,"""...'Among the three mentioned below, in order to gain two, sacrifice one'."" "
Gaap,"""It's a simple three choices. ......Decide for yourself which one you will choose to abandon."" "
Gaap,"""If you refuse to choose, the test will be suspended. I've been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands. ......If you want to include even that as a choice, then there are four options. "
Gaap,"It's been an awful long time since I've gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can't say I'd be disappointed."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Are these three choices only a test? Or will the consequence of my choice be carried out?"" "
Gaap,"""Don't be so naive. ...The one you choose will definitely lose their life."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""............"" "
,"{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below. {n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one. {n}{n}1. Your life {n}2. Shannon's life {n}3. Everyone else's lives {n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}} "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Why is Shannon's name here?"" "
Gaap,"""The second choice has the name of the one most needed and most loved by the test-taker. ...I believe Kanon's name is written second on Jessica's test."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"" "
Gaap,"""*giggle*giggle* ...You shouldn't be worrying about Jessica, right? Right now, you are the one being tested. "
Gaap,"It really is a simple three-choice test. Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two? ...Isn't that simple? If you still can't decide, would you like me to lend you a coin...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...A coin? How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"" "
Gaap,"""No one would throw away their own life. ...So, there remain two choices that will leave you standing. Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love? Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"" "
Gaap,"""Either way, you should be able to find a fitting just cause. After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island."" ""...The sentimental relationships of the Human world aren't necessary here. No one will blame you. Do as your heart desires. "
Gaap,"...And ask yourself whether you're qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family Headship..."" ""Or rather, make your decision as if you truly were the Ushiromiya Family Head, okay? Hehheheheheh..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Fuck you guys, ...mocking me like this......!"" "
,Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor. 
Ronove,"""I believe your anger is quite appropriate. ...I also find it an exceedingly pitiful...and yet truly humorous question. ...Pu ku ku ku."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""How could anyone wish to die themselves? And how could anyone want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the one they...l-love. ...And...how could anyone massacre everyone else, ...as long as it's good for the two of them...?!"" "
Ronove,"""No, Jessica-sama. Such a person could exist. "
Ronove,"This is Rokkenjima, the demon island! It is now completely cut off from the Human world and fully immersed in the spirit world like cheese fondue. Values of the human world get taken out with the trash."" "
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku! So please. Rank the things you desire from the bottom of your heart. Whatever remains will become a fitting answer for you in this insane evening."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Screw you!! How could I......choose any of these?!!"" "
Ronove,"""""If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost""... also makes for a fine fourth option. Even choosing that should give us an amusing show."" "
Ronove,"""But since that choice will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to be pure and choose the first one, ""your life"", so that the other two will be saved. ...Everything has been entrusted to your decision, Jessica-sama."" "
Ronove,"""Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship...!! I, Ronove, am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master's descendant who shares his blood!!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...D-Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt..."" "
,That scene was observed through the magic crystal ball Kinzo held. 
,"Kinzo finally couldn't hold it back and, spreading his arms and facing the heavens, began laughing in an explosive voice... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Fuhahahahahahaha, waahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!! What are you wavering for, foolish grandchildren, my descendants?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Isn't this problem so easy that you could answer right away? Isn't this a question that should cause you to waver less than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast?!! ...Do you people know the correct answer?"" "
,"He turned to face the Chiester Sisters, who had been waiting on him. "
Chiester45,"""N-N-No, my apologies, I don't know, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Fool, not choosing at all means game oveeeeeeeeeeeer!!! You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for your own life...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""You aren't worth a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!! Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!! ...And what of you?"" "
Chiester00,"""...I would sacrifice the first one, ""your own life"", sir. Weapons fight and die in battle. And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies. Being able to protect those we love and then die is our satisfaction, sir."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hoh. A truly splendid model answer for a weapon. The immediate reply is very nice. ...So, have you been raised to think you'll be given an extra carrot for answering that way? Heheheheh, that's wrong, seeeeeeeee? Even that is wrong, seeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Answering that way when you are asked is nothing more than giving the answer you have been indoctrinated with!! You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago. You still live without having chosen a purpose or goal to strive for...!! You filth that doesn't deserve to live...! It would suit you well to be crushed and used as fodder for the other livestock!!"" "
Chiester00,""".........! ...Yes sir! Animal fodder...would be an honor...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""That's wrong, riiiiiiight? You don't want to see anyone else die anymore, riiiiiiight? Why can't you accept that? Accept that the depths of the depths of your old wound are still festering and rotting...! "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"Yes, the rotting stench would make the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!! These are words of praise for you!!"" "
Chiester00,"""......Th-Thank you very much, ...sir..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Well then, what about you, the last one? Which of the three choices would you choose...?"" "
Chiester410,"""Nihi. Without wavering, I'd chose the second one."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hoh... The second. There are not many who could stick their chest out and choose to offer ""the one they love"" as a sacrifice. Tell me your reason."" "
Chiester410,"""Because the one you love will be lost eventually. If you don't love anyone, you won't get hurt, and if you lose someone, you still might be able to love again. So, the person you love right now isn't worth that much at all nyeh. ...Nihi!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""*cackle*cackle*cackle* I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly from pain caused by love... I have heard that rabbits can die from loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question. Why don't I change the second option to, not ""the one you love"", but ""the memories of the one you loved""?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...How is that? Can you still select that one? What's this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...?! "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!! Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""You can do it, right? I'll bet you can, riiiiiiiight? Cooooome on, try saying that you can, okaaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!"" "
Chiester410,"""Y-Yes, I can choose it... I can choose it...!! Nihi, ......nihihihihihihihihihiiihii..."" "
Chiester00,"""L-Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...! Please, stop this...!!"" "
Chiester410,"""Hihiiihiii... ...Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnggg...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Enough, rabbit filth!! Go to {f:5:Virgilia} and help keep watch on the dungeon. Disappear!!"" "
,"The Chiester Sisters, with their respective old wounds of the heart gouged out, escaped by disappearing. "
,"After that, even though there was no one to hear, Kinzo continued talking by himself as though in a play... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Indeed, that is the nature of this charming test. In truth, no choice can be said to be correct. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"Whichever answer they choose, it is about whether they can choose... without hesitation, quickly, and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""It's their reason and their willpower that are most essential. That is what I want to learn. Yes, my descendants, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answer you will show me!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Hmmmm? Me? *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me. Because I splendidly answered that devil's question, I was able to obtain gold and honor, and that witch as my possession. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"Which answer did I chooooooooooose? ......Do you really need me to say it out loud? Wahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"" "
Ronove,"""Well then, have you nearly decided on your answer...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""............"" "
,"As Jessica stared at the letter that had been crushed and lay on the floor, ...she hung her head in constant silence. "
,"All that filled the room was the stir from wind and rain shaking the treetops. Regardless of how noisy that was, it actually made the stillness more apparent. "
,"Ronove waited for Jessica's answer. ...However, Jessica didn't answer. "
,"Whether she was lost in deep thought or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn't tell. "
,"...No, ...he might actually have known. "
,"But cruelly, like a demon, ...Ronove urged Jessica to voice it. "
Ronove,"""......If you cannot choose any, ...I can at least bring you peace without pain, ...but..."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""............ ......me."" "
Ronove,"""...Yes? I had trouble hearing. Could you say it again please...?"" "
,Jessica lifted her face...and looked straight into Ronove's eyes. 
,...It seemed that she had decided on her answer. 
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Kill me."" "
,"Jessica said it one more time, ...clearly. "
,Perhaps Ronove had imagined that this would be her answer from the very beginning. 
,"...Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded. "
Ronove,"""...I thought you would choose that answer, Jessica-sama. ...Well then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test. The essential part is what thoughts led you to that answer."" "
Ronove,"""Come now. Please answer with a fitting attitude for the Successor."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......It's not like I chose the first one 'cause I wanna die. ...The second one was letting Kanon-kun die. Of course, that was out of the question. So I excluded it. ...The third one was everyone else's lives. Of course, that was also out of the question. So I excluded it. ...After that, only the first choice remained."" "
Ronove,"""Process of elimination, ...is it? So, it was not something you chose proactively..."" "
,"After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze. "
,...A Human couldn't even imagine what answer a demon would have been expecting. 
,...All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove's expectations. 
Ronove,"""...That answer is neither bad nor good. ...60 percent, I believe you could call it. ...I'm a little disappointed."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""You're a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self-confidence and then being disappointed when I do."" "
Ronove,"""......Apparently there was more to it than process of elimination. ...It's a failing grade either way, ...but there seems to be a little more to your thoughts. Allow me to ask."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""People don't want to die. ...So no one would want to choose the first option. ...People want to live in happiness...and struggle as much as life will let them. So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."" "
Ronove,"""......However, you took that first choice. You chose to throw away your own life. Only that choice remained for you."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I tried...thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."" "
Ronove,"""...Hoh. And what did you see...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""First, ......I tried letting Kanon-kun die. ......I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."" "
Ronove,"""What kind of life was it...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It was a horrible woman, who didn't deserve to live. A shabby woman who always lamented her own decision and lived only to regret. ...I could never forgive a horrible woman who'd choose to live and abandon the person she loved. ...I put an end to her myself."" "
Ronove,"""Heheh, how brave. ......So, did you also consider the third option?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Yeah. I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon-kun die. ...There's no way Kanon-kun would like me if I did that."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""So again, even with Kanon-kun, I was forced to bear the cross of abandoning so many people. ...And even Kanon-kun was forced to bear it."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......I'm not gonna make a foolish choice that leaves Kanon-kun bearing that cross. I wouldn't be able to forgive a future me who did something like that. ...I put an end to that woman myself too."" "
,Jessica had pictured it in her mind. The future her beyond each of the three choices. 
,"There were three Jessicas. ...Of the three, two had regrets. Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...You know, I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon-kun. ...Something about trying to live life to the fullest."" "
Ronove,"""Live your life to the fullest. ...Meaningful words. And a surprisingly difficult thing to do."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""So yeah. I've gotta stand proud and show Kanon-kun. ......Show him how to live by holding your head high and looking straight at the sun, with a full smile."" "
Ronove,"""...Will Kanon be able to accept your self-sacrifice? Haven't you thought that your selfish decision might hurt him more than is necessary...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That's why...I want to leave a message..."" "
Ronove,"""Hoh. ...I will listen, but I am after all a demon. ...I may not keep my promises, you see?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Keep it! Your promise!"" "
,Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned. 
,"She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she didn't think at all that she would be betrayed. "
,"...At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly and shrugged his shoulders. "
Ronove,"""Hmph... ...I see nothing wrong with that. So? What shall I tell him...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"‘...Tell Kanon-kun...to live his life to the fullest. ...No, that's not quite it. Not...Kanon-kun. ...He still hasn't told me his real name yet. Tell the real Kanon-kun to live his life to the fullest. ...Tell him that.’ "
Kanon,"""......Mi...lady..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Jessica, ...you really are......"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on. ...You certainly are fortunate to have me here showing you this scene."" "
,"A musty three-sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ...and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it. "
,"On the next mirror, ...the scene with George was reflected in the same way. "
,"None of them questioned how a three-sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies, nor did they wonder why these scenes with Jessica and George were reflected on it. "
,...Because the reflected scenes themselves were more important. 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Are you so prepared... ...to throw your life away...... ...for his sake......?"" "
Kanon,"""......... ...My...apologies..."" "
,Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression mixed in with a bitter smile. ...Kanon wouldn't meet his eyes. 
Kanon,"""...{f:5:Virgilia}-sama, ...there is no reason for Milady to throw away her life. ...Please kill me. Please change it to the second choice. ...That way, everything should resolve itself."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohhohohohohoho... I am not capable of granting that wish. ...After all, this is Jessica's own decision, which she herself chose."" "
,"At that time, suddenly, the air split and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into {f:5:Virgilia}'s chest. "
Chiester410,"""{f:5:Virgilia}‐samaaaaaaaaaaaa! Hiieeehheiiiiih!!"" "
Chiester45,"""So mean, so mean, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} is so meeeeeeeeaan, waaaaaaaaahhhh!"" "
Chiester00,"""I'm...doing the best I can... Crushing me for animal fodder, ...that's just too much. ...Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"" "
,"{f:5:Virgilia}, who still didn't have a clue what was going on, was mobbed by the sobbing Chiester Sisters. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Th-There, there. Everything's all right, don't cry... I'll make you some delicious tea... "
{f:5:Virgilia},"...I'm leaving it up to you all to guard this place. If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"" "
,"The goat attendants all faced each other, nodding their heads. "
,{f:5:Virgilia} took the Chiester Sisters and left. 
,"The sound of them going up stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......This is our chance. ...It looks like these goat heads are morons. ...I wonder if we can trick them..."" "
,"Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but even so, she hadn't thought of a way to break the metal bars... "
,"The Jessica reflected on the three-sided mirror had her eyes closed, as though in contemplation. "
,"...The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own aesthetic stance. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......That's all I have to say. ......Kill me."" "
Ronove,"""...Understood. ......Well then, ...fear not, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."" "
,"As Ronove raised his palm, ...he slowly approached Jessica... "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Dammiiiiiiiiiiittt!! Wrooggh!! Graaah!!"" "
,"Realizing that his daughter was about to be killed, Krauss went half-mad and repeatedly body-slammed the metal bars. "
,The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere Human didn't stand a chance at breaking those bars. 
,Krauss's pointless efforts certainly may have been comical. 
,"...But Krauss was giving it everything he had. He was now living with all he had as Jessica's father, so that he could save her. "
,......Kanon made tight fists with both hands. 
,"If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars. "
,"...But there were a full three goats. ...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant. It would instantly be reported, and then even {f:5:Virgilia} and the Chiester Sisters would probably dash in. "
,"Even if he could break the bars, ...that would be the end of it. ...It was useless. "
,"...Kanon already knew that the witch sneered at useless efforts like that, ...so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss's repeated body-slams... "
Shannon,"""...Ah, ......George-sama..."" "
,"Shannon, who had been looking at the three-sided mirror, raised her voice. "
,"...When they looked, they could see George, who had been silent the whole time, lift his face. ...It seemed that George had also decided on an answer... "
Gaap,"""......Have you decided? On your answer?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Yeah. ......I've decided."" "
Gaap,"""Is it an unwavering answer...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Yeah. It's unwavering."" "
Gaap,"""Then let me hear it. ......Oh, by the way, it seems Jessica decided to take the ""your life"" option. Surely, such an indecisive person as you isn't going to choose the same answer, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Jessica gave her own answer. ...No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica's answer. It doesn't influence my answer in any way."" "
Gaap,"""I see. Then let me ask again. ......Among the three mentioned below, in order to gain two, sacrifice one. "
Gaap,"""1. Your life. {nobr:2. Shannon's} life. {nobr:3. Everyone} else's lives. ......Which one will you choose? Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Wrong."" "
Gaap,"""Oh...?"" "
,Gaap looked a little surprised. ...Because she had thought this timid-looking man would obviously choose that option. 
Gaap,"""......... ...Very well then. I'm glad the most boring option for me has been removed. ...Then, as crazy as it sounds, ...could it be the second option? Can you abandon Shannon's life...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......You must be joking. Why would I do that to the person I was going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"" "
Gaap,"""......... ......How bold. Is that your answer...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......That's it. ...My answer is... the third option."" "
,"George took......the third option. ...""Everyone else's...lives"". "
,"Unsurprisingly, Gaap hadn't imagined that he'd give an answer like that. "
,"...She had been sure that he'd choose the same one as Jessica... So, she was interested in how he had reached that answer. "
,...How he had reached an answer that had surpassed the imagination of the 33rd ranked of the 72 demons? 
Gaap,"""I want you to tell me. ......I want you to tell me the circumstances that made it possible for you to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancée you love would be safe. ...Did you use the process of elimination, like Jessica?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Wrong. I clearly have no choice except this one."" "
Gaap,"""......So, you don't care what happens, as long as it's good for you? So, you can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""What are you even talking about?"" "
Gaap,"""......What......?"" "
,"George faced the demon as he spoke, almost as though he was disgusted. "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Tonight, I planned on calling Shannon right here and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement. "
Ushiromiya George,"......There probably are quite a few people who wouldn't celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon. I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I have been prepared. Since the time I came to this island......no, that's not it. ......Since the time I confessed that I wanted to engage her."" "
Gaap,"""......So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Marriage means... ...continuing to be your wife's ally for your whole life. ......At that point, ...I was prepared to have the entire world as my enemy for her sake."" "
,"Those words, through the three-sided mirror, ...also reached Shannon's ears. And that determination reached her eyes. "
,...Shannon certainly had promised to be given an engagement ring tonight. 
,"Then, this incident had occurred, and she hadn't been able to receive the ring. "
,"But now... ...Even though it wasn't in the form of a ring, Shannon had received something even greater. "
,"...And as proof of that, ...a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond... dripped down. "
Gaap,"""Heh, ...heheheheheheh...! What a courageous answer. I see, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."" "
Gaap,"""After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right? By now, there's no one whose death would trouble you."" ""Hahhahahahahahaha, I see, truly an easy choice. Ahahahahahahahaha..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Say whatever you want. This determination and choice are mine, ...and mine as the Successor."" "
,The sparkle in George's eyes was brilliantly sharp. 
,"...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of threat as Kinzo's...and was slightly overwhelmed. "
Gaap,"""......I see. ...Yes, the same decision as {f:5:Goldsmith}... ...So even with your innocent face, ...you will also become a terrible demon in the future. ...What do you know, we might get along pretty well."" "
Gaap,"""You will succeed {f:5:Goldsmith}. Eventually, I may even be summoned and serve you. ...That could be surprisingly interesting. ......Heheh."" "
,Gaap had needed to change her opinion of George. 
,"...This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance... and not just now, but since the very beginning. "
Ushiromiya George,"""I am prepared to inherit the Headship right away. ......No, that's not it. You told me to think as the Head in this test. So I answered based on the premise that I am the Head."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......No, even that's not it. I thought as the Head himself. ...I am now...the Head of the Ushiromiya family."" "
Gaap,"""............ Hehheheheheh... Splendid, to think that you'd be able to go so far. "
Gaap,"It seems you truly are one to be reckoned with. ...Battler's and Maria's tests remain, but I've got a good feeling that you'll pass."" ""......But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, you see?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Do you doubt my resolve?"" "
Gaap,"""Can you carry out the option you chose? Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices...? By your own hand...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I can. I've said I was prepared to do so several times."" "
Gaap,"""Ha, ......hahahahahaha! Then return to the guesthouse right away...and kill Battler and Maria! When that's done, I'll bring you the other hostages. Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes! You can do it, right?!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""{i:I can}. My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."" "
Gaap,"""............Nn. Then carry it out! Death for them all! Complete this bloodstained ceremony as the new Ushiromiya Family Head...!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Understood. I'll carry it out. I'm already the Ushiromiya Family Head."" "
Gaap,"""Yes, that's right! Stain that throne red by your own hands...! You will become the king of the spirit world who controls the demons...!!"" "
,Gaap was convinced. This man truly was fitting to succeed Kinzo's madness...! 
Gaap,"""Blow wind, cry thunder!! Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!! The demon island has now welcomed its new lord...!!"" "
,"In response to the demon's call, a tempest raged more and more. "
,"Then, a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light giving the sensation of a moment of silence... "
Ushiromiya George,"""So, ......about the order of the murders. I get to choose that, right?"" "
Gaap,"""Please, as you wish, your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima. As your heart desires...!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Well then, to start, that means the first one's gonna be you. Got a problem with that?"" "
Gaap,"""............Huh?"" "
,"A gust of wind blew, ...stirring up George's jacket as if it was a cloak. "
,It was very much like the cloak worn by the Head. It definitely carried that impression of dignity... 
,"...At that time, ...Gaap truly did see the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure-white and vast full moon. "
,The man who called himself the new head... bore the full moon on his back... and sneered at the demon. 
Ushiromiya George,"""Even the lives of the entire Ushiromiya family...are now part of my fortune. Reparations will be made for the damage that's been done. And it won't come cheap."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...You didn't seriously think you could take my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Aunt Rosa, and Genji-san's lives and expect me to overlook it, right?"" "
Gaap,"""Ho... ......hohoh, ......impertinence..."" "
,Ronove was trying to press his palm against Jessica's chest and stop her heart. 
,"But right before he could, his hand stopped... "
,"......On the carpet at their feet, ...one...two small red flowers bloomed with a *plop* *plop*. "
,"The seed of those flowers... was way up high, piercing into the heavens... ...on Jessica's fist. "
,Ronove's nose was stained red with spewing blood...... and those drops had been dripping onto the carpet. 
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden. ...My answer as the Successor is different."" "
Ronove,"""Allow me to ask..."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!! I'll protect them. If I'm the Head, then that's my duty! "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"Dad wasn't just swaggering around. He protected me and Mom!! ...He fought the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family...for decades!!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That's why I know. ...Being the Successor is nothing trivial. ...So you know what? I can give it up. ...Betting my own life is something I can do easily!!"" "
,Jessica knew. 
,"She knew that in order to protect her family, her father had bluffed and fought alone continuously. "
,Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her! 
,Another left straight was buried into Ronove's face. ...That terrifying strike wasn't due just to the brass knuckles she was using. 
,"It was a strike... of a person, a Family Head, who could throw away everything in order to protect. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""If Dad's lost his qualifications to be the Successor, then I, the next in line, will succeed the Headship. ...Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!! I'm not the kind of coward who'd let you do whatever you like any more!!"" "
Ronove,"""......A wonderful answer. I shall change your score from earlier. Plus 10 for that answer. ...Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Which means that...plus 20 more would make for a perfect 100, yeah?"" "
,"As Ronove jumped backwards, somersaulting in midair, he violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose. "
,"...It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose. "
,"The blood on his face was wiped off, ...and in its place... was a grin filled with a delight he hadn't felt in so many centuries that he couldn't remember. "
Ronove,"""I, Ronove, will test to see whether your resolve is worth full marks, understand...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Shut up, shut up!! Come at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"" "
Gaap,"""Come, into the Abyss...!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Whaaa?!"" "
,"Suddenly, beneath George's feet, a pitch-black pitfall opened its mouth wide. Of course, George had no way of resisting. "
,"After being swallowed up by that, George fell out of a pitch-black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor. "
,"As George fell down, he was hit by a reverse roundhouse kick from a sharp stiletto heel, like a strike from a carefully aimed bee...! "
,"The instant George, after being blown out of the arbor, thought that he'd be swallowed up by a rose bush... "
,Another pitch-black hole opened there and swallowed George up. 
,"And this time, a pitch-black hole opened at Gaap's feet before her eyes, spitting a defenseless George out of it. "
,"...At that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick. "
Ushiromiya George,"""Ghh, ...what is...this...?"" "
Gaap,"""Welcome back. *giggle*!"" "
,Right side of the head. Below the right armpit. Side of the right knee. 
,"As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone, she kept hitting him, left foot right foot left foot right foot, with successive roundhouse kicks. "
,"The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George's feet out from under him and making him fall down, but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch-black hole, and George was swallowed up once again. "
,Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone. George was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor. 
Gaap,"""......Take this and reflect. The Abyss ends with a single strike. ...Die...!"" "
,The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone. It kicked through George's lower chest as he fell from the ceiling... 
,"And then, ...time froze. George was pinned in midair by Gaap's raised leg... "
Ushiromiya George,"""Gah, ......mmph......"" "
,"Still pinned in midair, George moaned... "
,"Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot, ...grinned. "
Gaap,"""......I'll admit it. At least your attitude is that of an adult. But that's no good unless you have power to go with it. "
Gaap,"...Did you know? They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world. The first one is influence. The second is wealth. Do you know what the last one is?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I read it in a book. ...Force, right...?"" "
Gaap,"""Correct. And that's where you're lacking."" "
,Gaap finally released George. 
,"She kicked upwards one more time, changing into another roundhouse kick and knocking him into a pillar. "
Ushiromiya George,"""Ghh? ......Ung...uhhhgh......!"" "
Gaap,"""No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force. "
Gaap,"Kinzo possessed all three of those. That's why he reigned as a tyrant! ...If you're going to call yourself Kinzo's successor, try showing me a bit of that majesty, okay?"" "
Gaap,"""...Come ooon, how long are you gonna sleep there? Stand up, okay? If you don't, you'll {i:fall} again, see?"" "
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku ku. Not bad movements. But I feel they are slightly unfitting for a lady."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaard!! Swaying around all over the place!! Aren't you gonna strike back...? Don't take me lightly, you fuckin' bastard!!"" "
,"Ronove dodged skillfully, jumped back, and avoided Jessica's fist, but he still didn't strike back himself. "
,"Because of his dodge that was as rapid as a fluttering flag blown by strong winds, Jessica's fist wasn't even able to touch him. "
,"Amidst the sensation that her own blood was boiling, Jessica regained her offensive composure. "
,"Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was a very cramped place to keep up such exaggerated dodges in for long. "
,"...She calmly realized that and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well. "
Ronove,"""...Hoh. Boxing with just your arms makes you but half a fighter. Your arms must be like the hot roar of a lion. And your legs must be like the cold snake closing in on its prey."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Snakes don't have legs!"" "
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku, true."" "
,Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork. She didn't let him get around her. 
,"...Ronove's magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed a large footing. "
,"Once cornered, he wouldn't be able to dodge anymore...! "
,"Jessica knew the characteristics of her weapon, the brass knuckle, very well. "
,This powerful weapon's most notable characteristic was how it didn't give the opponent a chance to defend. 
,"Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage. ...If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone. "
,"So she cornered him. With this fist, ...she'd whittle away at this demon who'd lost any way to escape!! "
Ronove,"""Whoops...! Oh, when did...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Looks like I've finally cornered you, right...? Where is everyone being held? Where's that damn geezer? You tell me everything, and I'll let you off with nothing more than plucking that mustache off, got it?"" "
Ronove,"""That would be a problem. It does take me an hour every morning to set this."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Once you're in a cast, you won't even be able to do that, right?!"" "
Ronove,"""......Whoops. .........Gggh."" "
,"Ronove had blocked Jessica's fist with his arm. He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot. "
,"...Jessica grinned. Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly. "
Ronove,"""...I see. This certainly does hurt."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Here's my last bit of advice. Cry and apologize."" "
Ronove,"""That, I cannot do. It would ruin my image."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Then just crumple. Rapid fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!"" "
,Jessica's fists were buried into Ronove. 
,"But there was a resistance that seemed too hard...and the sound of breaking glass, which startled Jessica. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Wh‐......?!"" "
,"At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica's fist with his palm. ...That wasn't quite true. "
,"When Ronove opened his hand, a faint, purple, glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared, stopping the attack by a hair's breadth. "
,"Pulling herself together, Jessica let her fists fly again, but with a truly magnificent gesture, Ronove caught all of them... "
Ronove,"""I am, after all, a demon. This level of magic is nothing. ......Even so, you aren't bad at all. If I were a Human, I would probably resign right here. Because I am a demon, I can still continue to fight."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Wh-What are you trying to pull......?!"" "
Ronove,"""Is this the end? ...Are you simply going to attack all the time, while neglecting your defense?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Huh?!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"...Waaah!!"" "
,Ronove's palm shot to within a hair's breadth of Jessica's stomach. 
,"Jessica was knocked away by the purple shield, rolled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed. "
Ronove,"""My shield cannot be broken by a mere Human. Don't think that you'll ever be able to touch my body again."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...In that case, ...I'll just burst through that shield...!!"" "
Ronove,"""Persistent, I see. Yes, a truly fitting spirit for the Successor. ...Perhaps I'll be your opponent for just a while longer. This is also part of an examiner's role. ......Pukkukukukukuku!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Breeeeeeeeeeeaaaak, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"" "
,"Gaap looked down on George, sneering. George was on a path in the rose garden, lying face-down in a puddle. "
,"The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him... "
Gaap,"""......Ahhahahahahahaha. Stand up, okay? You'll fall again, right?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""............"" "
,George stood up shakily. 
,"...It seemed his spirit hadn't given in, but the damage done to his body was fairly significant. "
Gaap,"""Beg for your life. What you're doing now is the same as the fourth option of choosing nothing. ...You chose the third option, right? If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I'll forgive your rudeness towards me."" "
Gaap,"""Then, I'll guide you down to the dungeon. There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless life, you will kill the other hostages one by one. "
Gaap,"...You can do it, right? You did boast about having that resolve. ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*."" "
,George didn't answer. ...But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender. 
Gaap,"""...If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss, okay...? *cackle*cackle*cackle*."" "
,Gaap's strength was evident. 
,"...That was probably clear, even more than it was to George himself, to Shannon's group watching through the three-sided mirror... "
Shannon,"""......George-sama... ...That's... ......enough...... ...For someone like me..."" "
Kanon,"""Nee-san..."" "
Shannon,"""......If you didn't fall in love with me, ...you wouldn't have to fight with anyone, right, George-sama...? Then please, abandon me... Please forget me..."" "
,There was no way that voice could have reached George. 
,"...But, even so, ...George answered. "
Ushiromiya George,"""No way. ......I won't...surrender."" "
Gaap,"""...Oh? Why not...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Because that's...my resolve. ...I'll fight everything for Shannon's sake. And I'll make everything accept us... ...and bless us."" "
Gaap,"""Hey, could you tell me something? Why are you willing to go so far for that furniture called Shannon? ......She's just a washout, isn't she? Rubbish furniture that couldn't even make a satisfactory waitress."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......I won't permit any more insults against the woman I love."" "
Gaap,"""So what are you going to do about it? How could a weak kid like you resist me...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Loving someone is strength. ...Because I learned that, I was able to become strong. ......'Shannon, I love you'. With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."" "
Gaap,"""Shannon's in the dungeon, right? Professing your love to me won't-"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""No. She heard. ...That's because it's love. Shannon can hear my words right now. The reason I can believe that...is because of love."" "
Gaap,""".........You......"" "
Ushiromiya George,"‘Shannon, you aren't furniture. ...Even if you are furniture, you're mine alone, the only one for me in the world. I want you to be close to me as long as we live. ...I need you for all eternity.’ "
Shannon,"""......G-George-sama........."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I'm jealous. He's surpassed my husband in smooth talking."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...Th-That's youth for you."" "
Gaap,"""Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!! The strength of love? Then why are you so weak, boy? Does that weakness mean your love is also that weak? "
Gaap,"*giggle*giggle*! Even your love for your fiancée is weak. The way your parents died so quickly was weak. Everything about your life is weak."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Shannon taught me about love and strength. If you're trying to measure my love towards Shannon by my strength alone, ...let me teach you about my love."" "
Gaap,"""*giggle* So you say. ...I get it now. You're saying that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon."" ""In that case, what did you receive from your parents, who got killed way too easily? ......?"" "
,"At that time, there was a blackout. ...Even though they were outside? "
Gaap,"""......N-No. ......Th-This is......"" "
,The thing blocking Gaap's vision... ......was the bottom... of George's... ... shoe... 
Ushiromiya George,"""......Side kick. Nasal bone fractured."" "
,It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap's nose. 
Ushiromiya George,"""The thing I got from Mom was this kick."" "
,"Several moments after, Gaap jumped back. Of course, that was too late. "
,"If George hadn't stopped, he would probably have caused the damage he'd announced. "
Ushiromiya George,"""And what I got from Dad... ...is fortitude."" "
,Anger with a low boiling point isn't something to be truly feared. ...True anger is disciplined by fortitude. 
Ushiromiya George,"""......I recognize your violent method of declaring your intentions. ...I also see that you've slandered my fiancée and my parents' honor. And you have no intention of taking back what you said, yes...?"" "
Gaap,"""...Y-You..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I now understand your attacks more than enough, ......so maybe it's about time. Time to start fighting back."" "
Gaap,"""Q-Quit prattling, foolish boy...!!"" "
,A pitch-black hole opened its mouth at George's feet. 
,"But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole. The same move won't work again...! "
,"It was an extremely smooth dodge, and the upper part of his body didn't even quiver. "
Ushiromiya George,"""Fortitude means calmly analyzing how your opponent will act, instead of losing your cool. ......Why? Isn't it obvious? Can't you guess?"" "
Gaap,"""N-N-No, I can't..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them not want to take another pass at you, to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wash it off, to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over, to completely, perfectly, and thoroughly...!!! ...Beat them until they can't get up."" "
,George dashed. 
,"Pitfalls opened one after another, but George didn't step in them again. "
,"And, because he was persistent, he was able to reach Gaap a second time... "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Reverse roundhouse. Jaw fractured."" "
Gaap,""".........!"" "
,It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap's had been. 
,"Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap's face, it stopped a hair's breadth away. "
,Perhaps she couldn't rely on pitfalls at this close range. 
,"Gaap kicked at George's shins as a diversion, and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach. "
,It was a bee-like stab by her stiletto heel. 
,...But it sliced through the air where George no longer was. 
Ushiromiya George,"""......High axe kick. Collarbone fractured."" "
Gaap,"""......Gah-"" "
,"By Gaap's side, George calmly announced that, his foot still raised. "
,"If that monarch's heel had swung down, a collarbone fracture would probably have been the least of her worries. "
Gaap,"""This guy's... ...stronger than me...at close range...?! I need distance...!"" "
,She jumped backwards to open a large gap between them. 
,"She jumped and jumped and leapt and even flipped in midair, increasing that distance. "
,"It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it was very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal. "
,"If she opened the distance between them, she'd be able to fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...! "
Gaap,"""You fool, ...you'll regret the pride that made you let three chances of defeating me slide...as you fall into the depths of the Abyss!! .........Huh?"" "
,"When she magnificently landed and tried to aim a pitfall, a razor-sharp wind cut Gaap's bangs. ...Yes, it cut them. "
,"It happened twice. ...This time, it didn't just stop a hair's breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure... "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Armada com martelo. ...The fundus of the eye fractured with the first strike. Cerebral contusion with the second strike."" "
Gaap,"""............!!!"" "
,Gaap was too shocked to speak. 
,"George had closed in over all that distance in an instant, letting off a fearsomely nimble midair double-kick. "
,"...Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than several of her bangs. "
Ushiromiya George,"""I learned the power of kicks from karate, speed from tae kwon do, and freedom of range from capoeira. "
Ushiromiya George,"...Mom was pretty fickle. But I've learned from studying various merits."" "
Gaap,"""...Wh-Why don't you hit me...? ...You aren't going to say it's because I'm a woman, right?!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...You spoke of force as a monarch's third power. "
Ushiromiya George,"It looks like you still misunderstand the meaning of that force. ...In this situation, force doesn't mean hastily wielded violence. ......It refers to a deterrent, knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won't get away unharmed."" "
Gaap,"""A deterrent, ...you say...?"" "
,"In short, this is what it meant. This was why all of George's attacks up until then had stopped a hair's breadth away. "
,"These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly. "
,"...Also, if George had wished it, any one of those would probably have crushed Gaap. "
,"He had, daringly, not done that. "
Ushiromiya George,"""You said it yourself, right? Force is the power to control. ......If you crush your opponent with force, you won't be able control them, right? "
Ushiromiya George,"A monarch's force is something that is only shown. He does not crush. He makes others surrender and adds them to his own fortune."" ""If you start blowing bubbles, I won't be able to make you guide me to where the hostages are."" "
,Gaap had to admit it. 
,She had to admit that George understood force in its truest sense...! 
Ushiromiya George,"""You'll take me to where everyone is. I would advise against resisting. ...I won't stop short next time."" "
Gaap,"""...Ack!! ......Sorry, Lia. Lemme borrow your troops. This guy's too much for me alone to handle!!"" "
,"As a large, pitch-black hole opened in the sky, *thunk* *thunk* *thunk*, three muscular goat attendants fell out. They surrounded George. "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Reinforcements? Should I take this to mean that you take back all that about me being weak?"" "
Gaap,"""...I-I admit it. ...I made light of your...Human power..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""That's wrong. This is the strength of a man who's experienced love."" "
Gaap,"""H-How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!! Come, goats! Crush this man and turn him into meatballs!"" "
Gaap,"""*giggle* These goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power. I'll turn you into a corpse that even your fiancée won't be able to recognize!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood. ...Know that from now on, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""If you still plan on attacking me, prepare to sustain a great deal of damage."" "
,"When George proclaimed that, ...a faint, red magic circle rose up around him. "
,"It seemed that George couldn't see it. However, Gaap, being a demon, could. "
Gaap,"""...M-Magic?! Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?! And that's also...a counterattacking type...?! Is this...wh-what you meant by a deterrent...?!"" "
,"From a demon's perspective, that may have been magic. "
,"But in George's eyes, it was...determination. "
,"It was a determination filled with certainty, ...which would be merciless to anyone who wished to fight anymore... and which would force them to prepare for a significant counterattack. "
,Determination with certainty...becomes magic. 
,Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica's fists with his shield. ...But something felt odd. 
,"Even though he was certainly catching them on the shield, he felt his arm get jarred, and it hurt. "
,It should have prevented all physical damage. 
,"...However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, piling up. "
,"Ronove tried to act like he was composed, so that this wouldn't be noticed... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""H-Heheh...!! I'm not gonna get worn out. What's wrong, old guy? Starting to get a little tough...?!"" "
Ronove,"""...No matter how much you attack, it is useless. Why can't you understand that you cannot break my shield?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I'm not gonna stop hitting you just because it won't break. ......No matter how hard someone's heart is, if you keep on talking to them little by little, it'll eventually start to crack...! I believe it!! I believe that useless effort doesn't exist in this world!!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That's why I can live...to the fullest!! If words will eventually make it through, then the same goes for fists...!! ""Give up"" isn't written anywhere in my dictionary!!"" "
,"Those words were probably aimed at Kanon... Kanon, who had seemed to reject Jessica's words. ...But Jessica knew that, no matter how stubborn his heart was, those words would eventually soak through. "
,"She believed that they would surely reach his heart, that the day would come when he would stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself, ...and that he'd step out into a new life. "
,So Jessica didn't give up. She didn't lose heart...! 
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It's stupid, right? I'll bet a guy couldn't understand, right? A girl in love doesn't even think about giving up just because it's useless!!"" "
,"At that time, Ronove certainly saw. He saw the reddish glow of light that encircled Jessica's fists. "
Ronove,"""......This is...not good. ...An enchantment, is it? ...This permeating upgrade...will be troublesome."" "
,"Inside her unrelenting fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what. From a demon's perspective, that was magic. Determination with certainty...becomes magic. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""See? Nothing useless about it. ...Looks like my fists are making it through. Guard your arm, old guy."" "
Ronove,"""......It seems I will have to get a little more serious. ...It appears it is as you said. ...In this world, nothing is useless."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That's right...! If you give up because something's useless, that's when your life ends...! You'll get through. ...You can be sure of that...!!"" "
,"I'm an idiot, so this is the only way I can live, but even so, ...I'm sure I'll be able to teach Kanon-kun... about a new world someday!! "
,So I'm not gonna lose heart in a place like this...!! I'll definitely defeat you... and save everyone!! 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Damn!! Got to somehow...open a hole... Aaaaaaaaaaaaargghhh!!!"" "
,Krauss was repeating his useless effort to somehow open a hole between the metal bars. 
,...Useless. ......Nothing is useless. There's nothing... 
,The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pitfalls and disappeared. 
,...Now was their once-in-a-lifetime chance. 
,This was their only chance to break the bars... 
Nanjo Terumasa,"""S-Stop it, it's impossible, Krauss-san! There's nothing we can do with our bare hands! Let's look for a tool, don't waste time on the impossible...!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""If you give up because it's useless, then it's all over. That's what my daughter said. ...Even if my body won't fit, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon can make it through...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Now that we've reached this point, action is more important than racking our brains. Let's work together, I'll do it too...! ...Kanon-kun, you're a boy, aren't you? Lend a hand...! ...Kanon-kun?!"" "
Kanon,"""......Krauss-sama, please stand back."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""What? What are you planning...?"" "
Kanon,"""...Okay, Nee-san? ......Just one more time, let's try struggling."" "
Shannon,"""......Yes. ...I too...will struggle one more time. ...No, not just one more time. ...Over and over again."" "
,"Jessica's voice had reached Kanon. It certainly had permeated into his cold, rock-like heart. "
,"And George's voice had reached Shannon. If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way. "
,An incredible metal sound rang out. 
,"......In the first flash, several metal bars were severed horizontally, and in the next flash, they were severed horizontally again, causing many metal bars to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword. "
,"Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn't even have a clue what had just happened... "
Kanon,"""...Doctor Nanjo, which way down the corridor goes to the mansion...?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......O-Oh, of course! In and to the left, ...in and to the left...!"" "
Shannon,"""Let's go, Krauss-sama. ...{f:5:Virgilia}-sama will notice us at any moment now."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""What in the world... ...are you guys...?"" "
Kanon,"""......We are..."" "
,"When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke. "
Shannon,"""We're Human."" "
Chiester45,"""V-{f:5:Virgilia}-sama!! Response from the lookout web, it's a jailbreak! The goat guards aren't there for some reason...!!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...Whaaat?! Why?! ......It's Gaap, isn't it? Taking someone else's summonings without asking!! ...Gap! Gapgap!! "
Chiester00,"""...Confirming Battle Regulations. Requesting permission to fire at the escapees."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Do it...! Kill them, kiii-!! Gapgapgap, gap, gya!!!"" "
Chiester00,"""Understood. 45, 410, Prepare for Sniping Pursuit Combat. Ammo Type, Guided Cluster Rounds. ...{f:5:Virgilia}-sama, an escape prevention barrier, if you would."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Owowowow... Y-Yes, you're right. Hohhoho, I won't let you escape from here. ...Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."" "
,"The underground passage in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars. The door was, of course, locked. "
,"...However, that was no problem for them now. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Kanon, it's those metal bars again! We're counting on you...!"" "
Kanon,"""Yes, Krauss-sama...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Still, that's incredible. ...I wonder what kind of principle it works on."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I'm not interested in principles. All that matters is that he can sever the metal bars...and that we can escape from here...!"" ""Don't worry, Kanon, do it!"" "
Kanon,"""Leave it to me...!"" "
,"Kanon sliced the metal bars again with his red curved blade. But there was a harsh, strange noise, and the metal bars only had a slight scratch. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Wh-What's this? ...These are sturdy..."" "
Kanon,"""Wrong. ...They're enchanted! It's one of {f:5:Virgilia}-sama's magic locks."" "
Shannon,"""Can you cut through it?"" "
Kanon,"""Of course. But it will take time."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""We'll wait three minutes...!"" "
,"After taking a deep breath and concentrating his mind, Kanon extended a red curved sword again. "
,"When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was melting through it with a burner. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""It looks like we'll be able to cut it, ...but it'll be tough."" "
Shannon,"""......Krauss-sama, you've been targeted by the enemy. Please move back."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Huh? Pursuers? There's no one coming!"" "
Shannon,"""Please get behind me. They're aiming for you...!!"" "

Chiester410,"""410, nihhihihihi! Firiiing!!"" "
,"A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind. It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed...! "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""S-Something shone!!"" "
Shannon,"""...You can't block the golden arrow with a shield. Kanon-kun, Interception Stance. Let's link."" "
Kanon,"""Gatekeeper, understood. ......It's been a long time since I've fought with you, Nee-san. Don't screw up."" "
Shannon,"""Yeah. I'll be serious."" "
Kanon,"""Then there's no problem!"" "
,Kanon stopped cutting the bars and stood in front of Shannon. 
,"Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path... "
,A Guided Cluster Round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub-rounds bound together. It explodes mid-flight and divides into 48 mini-arrows. 
,"The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess a perfect wounding and killing power against personnel. "
,"And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets. "
Kanon,"""......It shone. ...It's divided..."" "
Shannon,"""Confirming Guided Cluster Round Division. 46...7...8... ...48 Sub-rounds, All Rounds Locked Onto. Interception Control. Data Link to Kanon."" "
Kanon,"""Kanon, Data Received. ...You're incredible, Nee-san. You can actually ""see"" all 48."" "
Shannon,"""Concentrate on Interception Prioritization. Trust your Nee-san."" "
Kanon,"""Of course. I don't even need to open my eyes."" "
Shannon,"""Commencing Interception."" "
Chiester45,"""T-Target Unharmed!! I-It was intercepted...!!"" "
Chiester410,"""Nihyah?! All 48 of them?!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohohoh... After all, Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair. They're strong when they're together. ...Owowow. ...Is this gonna become a mouth ulcer or something...?"" "
Chiester00,"""Calm down, Reload. ...Updating Ammo Type. Precision Light-Speed Sniper Rounds. Preparing for Precision Sniping."" "
Chiester410,"""Sounds good nyeh, impossible to intercept super high-speed rounds! Impossible for a mere Gatekeeper to defend against nyeh!"" "
Chiester45,"""Precision Sniping, roger that. Commencing Collection of Precision Firing-use Data......"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Wh-What in the world was that just now...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Don't worry, I don't have a clue either... All I know is that we would've died if not for these two..."" "
Shannon,"""Kanon-kun, thanks. Go back to the metal bars. The next shot will probably be one we can't intercept."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""How can we defend against such an attack...?!"" "
Shannon,"""We don't let them shoot. ...Kanon-kun, Initiate Spirit Particle Combat Countermeasures."" "
,"At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and ground his teeth. ...With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact that only nonhumans could perceive struck. "
Chiester45,"""...Huh?! Firing System Error!! No good, Rebooting... Huh huh?!"" "
Chiester00,"""It's Spirit Wave Jamming! Activate Spirit Particle Safeguards, hurry! What are you doing?! Cover your ears quickly, 45!!!"" "
,"An unseen, unheard impact had struck the Chiester Sisters. "
,"00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears, ...but 45 didn't make it in time. "
,"...As she stood bolt upright, her eyes rolled. "
Chiester45,"""Ukyu...?!?!"" "
Chiester45,"...Kyuu? Kyu-! Kyu- kyu- kyu-!!!"" "
Chiester410,"""45 got damaged...! Her IME's busted...!! ...Nn, gya, ...the noise...is also horrible for me nyeh..."" "
Chiester00,"""45, 410, ...and 00, Damaged... Abandoning Sniping Posture. ...Ack, it came straight through the link... I-If we don't reboot..."" "
,Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired. 
,"They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released, and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Are you okay?! ...I'll make you some more delicious black tea later, so get ahold of yourselves!"" "
Chiester00,"""...M-My apologies, sir... Rebooting. Please wait several hundred seconds..."" "
,"All of the Chiester Sisters had fallen over. They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if only for a moment. ......I see, a plot to entertain that child truly will be filled with unexpected turns!"" "
,"{f:5:Virgilia} tore the air with a large gesture, motioning as though opening a door. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Come, arise, goat attendants...! It's time to work. Catch and kill the escapees. Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"" "
,A gold-colored door opened in the air...and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out... 
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Come now, hurry. There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win! There will be a wonderful prize, so give it your all, give it your all!"" "
,"{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, urging them on. "
,"A prize?! After facing each other at those words, the goats all rushed to the door at once, trying to get out, making the exit as packed as the Touzai or the Yamanote rail lines in the morning. "
,"Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out. ...{f:5:Virgilia} held her head in frustration. "
,"By that time, Kanon had managed to cut enough bars to make a crack that could be slipped through. "
,"It had been a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, with his lethal waist, but even so, they all managed to make it through. "
,"But after they did, they only had a couple seconds to be relieved. "
,"Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""This certainly is secure. ...I'll bet they really didn't want the people in here to escape."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Kanon, sorry, but I'll have to ask you again. ...It may be tough, but please...!"" "
,There was sweat on Kanon's forehead. 
,"You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, had physically exhausted him. "
Kanon,"""...Yes, leave it to me, Krauss-sama."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Only you can do it! Please, we're counting on you...!"" "
,"Only he...could do it. ...Holding tightly onto those words, Kanon concentrated his mind once again and set himself to the task of cutting metal bars again. "
Shannon,"""......Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple targets."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Yeah, this time even we can tell. ...The ground's really shaking. I can tell that some ridiculous monsters are rushing at us."" "
Shannon,"""Don't worry. I'll use a magic lock to make a blockade of the metal bars we just came through. Mere goats won't be able to break it."" "
,Shannon held her hand out towards the metal bars they had gone through. 
,...But she stopped right away. 
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Wh-What is it...?"" "
Shannon,"""{f:5:Virgilia}-sama has started neutralizing the Spirit Wave Jamming... It'll be bad if it's broken, and we'll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""I'll make you pay in full for bullying these cute bunnies."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""If you're trying to gain the advantage with those clever spirit particles of yours, I'll tear all that away and rob you of them."" "
Kanon,"""Nee-san, concentrate on the Spirit Wave Jamming! The gap in those metal bars is too narrow for those goats. It should hold them back for a while...!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I don't have a clue what you're saying, but-"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""We know it's something pretty bad."" "
,"Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut. Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fists, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...I believe these are the final metal bars blocking the way."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""How far is it to the mansion from here?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Quite a walk... The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for 30 minutes..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""So if we run all out, it'll be half that time."" "
,"They couldn't tell for sure, since they didn't have the three-sided mirror, but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica would still be all right against demon opponents after all this time. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...If we run at twice the speed of walking, it'll be 15 minutes. And twice that speed would make it eight minutes."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""And if we sprint all out at double that speed, it won't even take 5. No problem."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Wh-What an unreasonable calculation... But that's how you calculate in a fire...!"" "
Kanon,"""...My sincere apologies, everyone. Please watch my back...!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Leave it to us. Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can. Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called {f:5:Virgilia} or whatever. Kyrie-san and I will defend against our pursuers...!"" "
,"Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and several fiery, glowing, bright-red eyes appeared. "
,Goats that were several levels more massive than the guards were rushing with an incredible force. 
,"The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake. They brought a frightening intensity and terror, but Kyrie actually laughed with relief. ...Those massive bodies wouldn't be able to go through the crack in the bars! "
,The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a fierce sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end. 
,"Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had bent as if collapsing. "
,"...Their charging power probably was on par with a train. If the metal bars hadn't been there, they would likely have overwhelmed the five of them and crushed them in an instant. "
,"When the group of goats pressing up against the metal bars noticed the five people right in front of them, they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five. "
,...Or maybe that was out of pain from their game of push and shove. 
,"One calm goat among them figured out what should be done about the metal bars, then grabbed two of them with its massive arms and began bending them as though opening double doors. "
,Kyrie sharply jabbed her metal pole at that goat's vitals...! The goat let out a roar of anguish. 
,"It probably hurt a lot, but that was all. It wasn't enough to bring it down... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Krauss-san...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Whoooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"" "
,"Still holding the metal pole she had stuck out, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss. "
,"Krauss ran there with all his might, jumped up and kicked down with all his weight and kicking power combined...! "
,"All of that destructive power was focused on a single pole, drilling it in!! "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...A-Are you okay? Please don't rub the affected area. I'll prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."" "
,"As the goat who'd taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes, it nodded its head. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Looks like our link isn't that bad either. We won't lose to Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Naturally, for a loving family like us."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""We can do it if we take them together! Next, that one on the right!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Understood...! You really are a good wife. That Rudolf must have grumbled a little too much."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Ooh, tell me about it later. Rudolf-san, suddenly turning pale in heaven won't do you any good, okay?"" "
,"The goats' massive bodies were buried in rose bushes. Even taking into account that a leg's power is three times that of an arm's, this strength surpassed common sense. "
,To think that those massive bodies had been kicked in the chin and flown through the air... It was too fierce! 
,Even George seemed a little surprised. 
Ushiromiya George,"""...To think that my kick works on monsters too. Now there's a shock."" "
Gaap,"""......It's because of your counterattack-style barrier. ...The attacking power that grazes you is added on to your own. ...Your kick has been supplemented by those monsters' superhuman strength..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Oh...? ...I don't really get it, but isn't that just perfect for me? ...No matter who attacks me, they should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure. Nonaggressive defense. That's my policy."" "
,That's why Gaap couldn't easily touch him. 
,"The counterattack-style barrier had no defensive power. However, because of its countering ability, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack. "
,"The goats had been foolish and so had attacked without worrying, but this second effect had worked in full against Gaap. "
Ushiromiya George,"""These guys really are dull. When your power's even, it's always an advantage to have a smaller build."" "
,He lightly dodged the log-like arms. 
,"When those arms touched the barrier that protected George, they let off a strong, red light. "
,...The tip of the counterattacking foot would then gain the same sparkle...and the superhuman power of the goat added to its own. 
,"The second goat fell forward and floated in the air for a second. Then, George's next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat's head. "
,"...For an instant, the goat hoped it might get away with its life. "
,"But no!! A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground. "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right? Works pretty well every now and then."" "
Gaap,"""This guy's...a problem, ...seriously, a problem...!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""What do you mean, demons? What do you mean, witches? ......The rulers of Rokkenjima are the Ushiromiya family. I'll make you physically aware of that."" "
Gaap,"""......Yoooooooooooouuuuuu......!!"" "
,"The only way to finish off George, now that his body was wrapped up in a counterattack-style barrier, ...was to deny him a chance to counterattack. "
,"...Nothing to do but suck him into the Abyss next, then kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him... until she kicked him to death!!! "
,But George had already completely seen through the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap's pitfalls. 
,"...If he could jump over that next pitfall, ...then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap's head with his whirlwind-like kick, without holding back in the slightest, ...just as had been done to his parents. "
,She was able to envision that scene vividly. 
,Gaap hated Kinzo more than ever for calling her out to this ridiculous island...! 
,"Even though Ronove held out a shield, he had finally started using his hands. "
,"Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn't be able to block Jessica's fists anymore. "
,The enchantment on Jessica's fists grew the more she fought. 
,"The permeating upgrade had already grown several times, and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......What's wrong?! Starting to get tired?! You're getting all slow!!"" "
Ronove,"""No. Your movements and thoughts and kinetic vision have been rapidly enchanted. ......My movements have not changed from the beginning. ...Your movements are beginning to catch up to me."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""And you still won't fight back...?!!"" "
Ronove,"""This is my style. ...However, I cannot allow it to continue at this rate. It's about time for me to get serious and end this...!!"" "
,Ronove's face turned into an expression he hadn't shown before. It was full of respect for Jessica in a truly demonic way. 
,Because it was an expression he only showed for enemies who made him get serious. 
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Whooaa?!?! What the?!"" "
,"With a gesture of his whole body that you couldn't call elegant, Ronove held out a shield with all his strength, a shield the size and thickness of a wall. "
,It was more tenacious than a simple shield. It literally was a wall. 
,"And on top of that, with all of Ronove's magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit. "
,...Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death? 
,"Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid. ...Without any exaggeration, it was solid! "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Is this what you call serious...?!! No problem, I'll break right through iiiiiiiiiiitt!!"" "
Ronove,"""I will not let you this time. This wall is somewhat different. ...Here, allow me to enchant it as well."" "
,"When Ronove made a magic sign almost like a ninja, the wall glowed red for just an instant...and some kind of ominous power dwelt within it. "
,Jessica was able to recognize that almost immediately with her body. 
,"Every time her fists hit the wall, pain as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body rebounded against her. "
Ronove,"""I upgraded it with attack-reactive armor. An exceptional item that will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them... and which can even counterattack with reactive fragments."" "
Ronove,"""...It's perfectly fine to keep punching it, but doing so will damage you as well."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Heh, ...heheh!! In short, it's an endurance test between me and your wall?!! No problem!!"" "
Ronove,"""Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first? ...Allow me to observe."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Except I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, right?! Watch iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"" "
,"Without hesitation, Jessica punched using both fists. Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, torturing her entire body. "
,"Instantly, several red gashes appeared all over her... "
,"She grimaced at the intense agony, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin that stood in sharp contrast to the pain...! "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Kanon, are you done yet?! We're fine, ...but the metal bars blocking them don't seem to be...!"" "
Kanon,"""Just...a little more...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""There's no stopping these guys... These metal bars might break just from them shoving each other!"" "
,"The group of goats made the metal bars creak. Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength. "
,"...However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands. Apparently, they really were stupid. "
,The way those countless hands grabbed the metal bars...sometimes happened to match up by chance. 
,Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right. 
,"The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that crack was getting larger bit by bit...! "
,"They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren't getting anywhere. They couldn't stop the gap from spreading left and right...! "
,"At that time, there was a loud metal sound behind them. Kanon had finally finished cutting. "
Kanon,"""Quickly!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Kyrie-san, ladies first. You go next, Doctor Nanjo!"" "
Kanon,"""Krauss-sama, please leave this place to me...! Nng, ...this is?!"" "
,Kanon's red sword that had cut the metal bars disappeared. 
Shannon,"""...Sorry! We've entered {f:5:Virgilia}-sama's Spirit Particle Area of Influence!! Our magic power has been neutralized!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohhohhoh. How dare you resist me this far... I, who was called a Great Witch. You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."" "
,A magic circle column drew a complex magical formula with {f:5:Virgilia} at the center. 
,"...With such genuine magic being used, Shannon's power couldn't even compete. "
,"On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as long as she had. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Spirit Particle Supremacy Ensured. Come, Chiester Sisters. It's your turn now, right? "
{f:5:Virgilia},"Wait, are you still rebooting?! Why are kids these days so bad at waking up...?!"" "
Chiester00,"""M-My apologies...!! We're all different versions..."" "
Chiester410,"""Why is it that the shortcuts and pulldown menus get all screwed up every time you change versions nyeh...! Did not shut down successfully last time? Administrator privileges?? What's going on I don't knooooooow!!"" "
Chiester45,"""Ukyu~~!! Ukyu-!! (Fix me quickly-!! Waaaah!)"" "
Chiester00,"""Call the Imperial Guards' Troubleshooting Team! What? You can't help us without a user code?!"" "
Chiester410,"""45 had the user code nyeh."" "

{f:5:Virgilia},"""......... Y-You take your time fixing yourselves... I'm going..."" "
,"""""Sorryyyyyyyyy-!!"""" "
,"The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning. "
,{f:5:Virgilia} was again shocked by this congestion. 
{f:5:Virgilia},"""What are you doing...?!! "
{f:5:Virgilia},Huh? You want to go first because you want the prize? You're getting in each other's way because you don't want the other goats to steal the prize from you? 
{f:5:Virgilia},"You stupid goooooooooooooaaaats!!! I'm going, so make way!!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""What?! You don't want to?! {f:5:Virgilia}-sama is trying to steal your prize?!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Why are you all standing arm in arm?!! "
{f:5:Virgilia},"Aaah, tight, cramped!! When did this become a goats-only car?! Ugyu-!! You, that kid who just touched my butt, get off at the next statioooon!!!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Hmm? What's with you? Come this way, you say??"" "
,The five in Krauss's group dashed through the passageway with all their strength! They couldn't dawdle around in an underground place like this. 
,"They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface! If they could meet up, there would no longer be any more sorrow! "
,"At that time, a terrible rumble started chasing them. Had their pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?! "
,But they couldn't see anyone when they turned around. 
,"However, that rumble and the dirt that fell here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer, finally catching up with them and even going past them. "
,It felt almost like being chased by ghosts. 
,"For a second, they thought they'd gotten away, until the ceiling in front of them fell in...and a single goat stood in their path. "
,...{f:5:Virgilia} was sitting on its shoulder. 
{f:5:Virgilia},"""This wise child knew a shortcut. What a good kid, you get first prize. Later, you can have some handmade mackerel curry."" "
,Maybe it really was happy about that dubious prize. The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and writhing. 
,"{f:5:Virgilia} leapt down, laughing that this time, it was finally checkmate. "
Kanon,"""...Damn, ...it's no use... ...Our magic has been completely killed..."" "
Shannon,"""...Not yet... ...Even without magic, we still have these bodies..."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""D-Don't be ridiculous...! There's no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...St-Stay back, children... "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"I'll do something about this, so escape past the sides of that monster while I distract them...!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""I won't let you. Hohhohohohohoho!"" "
,"When {f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, a purple magic circle wall appeared behind her, stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Is there...nothing more to be done...? ...N-No, not yet. ...Even Jessica fought. I must do so as well..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""A-Are you serious?! It's not possible, not against that massive monster...!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Don't be absurd...! Krauss-san, let us think of another way..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""If you think of something, say it. Until then, it looks like I'll have to manage something... ...Come on, get back."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Take care."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohohoho, ...hohhohohohohohohoho! My, my, Krauss. You intend to fight this child alone?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,""".........Nngg... Y-You never know. In a fight, it's always possible to get in a lucky shot..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohhohohoho. You think you can win even with a fluke...? Allow me to explain so that even one who so blissfully unaware of his place can understand."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""What...?"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohohoho... If you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6. In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000. In short, even if there were 100 of you, you definitely couldn't win. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"Well, it's true that there are uncertain elements in a fight. Let us admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"But even so, your chances of defeating this child are at perhaps 0.00001%. Do you understand? You don't even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory. Hohohohoh...!"" "
,{f:5:Virgilia} and the goat guffawed together. 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""D-Damn it... If I've got a one-in-ten-thousand chance, that means the payoff will be ten thousand times greater, right? ...A splendid dark horse. Seeing a ticket like that makes me want to buy it right away..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohohohoh! But the coin to buy it is your life, and you've only one of those, yes? However, I can understand why you'd still want to entrust that miracle to fate."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...Therefore, I shall praise your courage for standing against us without fear...and give you a bit of a handicap. This child will fight with only his left arm. Well, even so, I have absolutely no intention of losing to you."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Come to think of it, what's that *bing*bong*bing*bong* noise I keep hearing?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...V-Very well. I'll take that challenge... Whether it uses its left arm or not, I'm sure I'd be killed with a single strike. ...I also only have a single chance at a strike. I can only bet everything on that."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""That's absurd, Krauss-san...! I know you used to do boxing, but wasn't that as far back as your college days...? No, no, even if you were a pro boxer, there's no way you could defeat a monster like that with one strike...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...That would be true if it were a match in the ring. But while Krauss nii-san's chance to bet on this hope is faint, it does exist. ...He's betting everything on that hope..."" "
Kanon,"""Y-You aren't saying... But there's no way that would work out..."" "
Shannon,"""...Krauss-sama......"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""W-Watch me... I'll settle this with a single strike..."" "
,Hohohohoh... How shallow. I know what you're after. The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters. 
,"If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double what is normal. Both will crash together, so it's a relative four times normal. "
,"Even if, on top of that, the strike lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power again. "
,"......In short, Krauss's maximum power level of 6 times 8 would be 48 at the most. "
,He might or might not be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times. 
,"Hohhohohohoho, if you're killed every time you take a hit and your damage still accumulates, ...let's see, perhaps you might finally win when we get to Episode 24, yes? "
,"Hohohohoh, if only this series could stretch on so long...!! Either way, you don't even have a slight chance at victory! "
,"...Hey, seriously, what is that *bing*bong* sound? "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Let me bet everything on a single strike... You have no reason to hold back either, goat-kun. Come at me seriously..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hohohoho, he's requesting that you go all out. Smash him with a single serious strike...and turn him into chunks of meat."" "
,"As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint. "
,"Hohohohoh, is this what you wanted? "
,Bet your hopes on the greatest limits of your power level...and despair when even that gets you nowhere! 
,It rang again! What the heck?! It's really starting to get on my nerves! 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Here I go... Ready?"" "
,The goat howled in response. 
,"Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend, ...the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun. "
,"The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each. "
,The goat's fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss's face. 
,"...He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards, when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away, and when he would win perfectly. "
,"The long, painful days up to that point drifted through the goat's mind... "
,Those painful days of training when his senpais had picked on him... 
,Those faint glimpses of the warm concern his senpais felt for him. 
,"And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, when he had been accepted as one of the comrades...! "
,I never showed proper respect to my parents. 
,"...That's right, didn't I plan to wash my hands of this business when this job was over...and return to my hometown? "
,"I'm sorry, little goat sister... Your Onii-chan always caused you so much trouble. "
,"And I...a-actually have a childhood friend, ...and I'm gonna marry her when I got hooooome!!! "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!! Nooooooooooo!! Stop tripping all those loser flaaaaaaaaaaags!! "
{f:5:Virgilia},"You can't handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"" "
,It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed. 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You fool, {f:5:Virgilia}. Looks like you failed to make a calm and rational decision."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""You mustn't take that punch!! Knock it aside!!"" "
The Goat Butler,"""?!?!"" "
,"The very instant the goat's left straight and Krauss's right straight crossed...! The goat obeyed {f:5:Virgilia}'s order with super-fast reflexes and pulled his straight back, repelling Krauss's punch! "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Nng-"" "
,"That's right, {f:5:Virgilia}'s decision probably had been wise. After all, the number of loser flags amplifies the power level of one's opponent! "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""That was close, if you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been amplified to...!!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!! "
{f:5:Virgilia},What? That promise about fighting with only your left arm? 
{f:5:Virgilia},Hohohoh!! Aren't promises made to be broken?!! 
{f:5:Virgilia},"Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I'm disappointed, {f:5:Virgilia}. You really have lost your composure."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""What's that...?! How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"" "
Shannon,"""Wh-Why is that, Kyrie-sama...? If they had crashed like that, wouldn't it have been Krauss's..."" "
Kanon,""".........Ah, I, I see...! ...even with 20 loser flags, ...that's not enough!"" "
,"Krauss's and the goat's double rush made for times 4. With a miracle as an ally, the firm promise of a critical hit doubled it again for times 8. "
,"On top of that, there was an amplification of times 20, equal to the number of loser flags, making for x160. "
,"At a glance, that was an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss's power level was 6. Even multiplied by 160, it only made for a power level of 960. Just barely below the goat's 1000...! "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's why I said you weren't composed. It's your blunder. If they had crashed like that, you would have won."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""H-Hohohohoh!! Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss's head!! Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Take this, the strongest strike of the boxing world."" "
,"After repelling Krauss's right straight, the goat's right straight attacked the right side of Krauss's face, which had been left open... "
,"But there, it crossed Krauss's left straight... "
,"The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other... "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Ho, ......hohohoho. To think that it would be timed for a simultaneous strike! But his power level stops at x160, making it 960!! It doesn't reach up to my child's 1000...!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......No. {f:5:Virgilia}-san, ...it's your loss."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Why?!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""You made him repel the first cross-counter. ...Certainly, if another right straight after that were to hit, Krauss-san would probably be in pieces."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...However, that was crossed... ...That's no good. Sorry, but this is a complete loss for you and this goat."" "
,A cross-counter has four times the destructive power of a normal punch. This is common knowledge in the boxing world. 
,"And if it's blocked and the right straight hits, then it's a double cross-counter, with 8 times the destructive power. This is also common knowledge in the boxing world. "
,"And if that is crossed... Then, by the principle of leverage, the triple cross would multiply the destructive power by 12! "
,This is also painfully common knowledge in the boxing world!! 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Krauss-san's power level is 6."" "
Kanon,"""The rushing from both sides is times 4."" "
Shannon,"""Th-The critical hit is times 8."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""And times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...And times 12 again for the triple cross-counter."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...T-Times 1920..."" "
,His power level is 11520...!! Krauss's punch now had the power to easily win the first Tenkaichi Budokai...!!! 
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...This result was brought about by Krauss-san's persistence in not giving up on victory until the end...and your pride. Without either, this strength would not exist..."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...You fought well. ...You may now fall..."" "
,Nanjo clapped the goat on the shoulder... 
,...Y-Your Onii-chan...gave it his all... 
,"As the sparkling drops from the goat's eyes scattered, he bent backwards, and fell on {f:5:Virgilia}. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Ugyu-!! Heavyyyyyyy, get off meeeeee!"" "
,"The goat's massive body was too heavy for the slender {f:5:Virgilia}. She wriggled around with it on top of her, but it didn't look like she'd be able to escape. "
,"In that instant, the barrier {f:5:Virgilia} had sealed broke. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Don't take it personally. It was the principle of leverage that led to your defeat."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I wonder how the principle of leverage applied to that counter. It's an eternal mystery."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Let's escape while we can...!! You take care too, goat-san...!"" "
Shannon,"""W-Well then, excuse us, {f:5:Virgilia}-sama!"" "
Kanon,"""......*bow*."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Waaaaaaaaiiit!! Wait uup!! Get this off meeeeee!! Kiiii---!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"" "
,"After that, there was nothing to block their way. ...They ran intently through the underground passage...! "
,"Jessica had finally been cornered, with the wall at her back. ...Ronove advanced with his magic circle wall bit by bit...and would probably crush her against the other wall eventually. "
,"Considering the distance, she threw out her fists... This would be her final strike. "
,Jessica had dealt out many punches so far. 
,"...The wall wasn't invincible. It had already started to crack, and it wouldn't be strange for it to smash at any moment. "
,"However, due to the rebounding damage, Jessica also had cuts all over her body...and was all worn out. "
Ronove,"""...Please put a stop to this. I don't intend to crush you. It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you. ...However, I also intend to congratulate you specially for your good fight."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"'Hey! Quit fucking a- around... ...Not yet... It isn't...over yet......"" "
Ronove,"""...You have wounds all over your body. It's all you can manage just to stand, is it not? ...It seems you plan on putting all your strength into this final strike. However, that final strike will be fatal for you."" "
,The damage reflected by Ronove's magic circle wall was proportional to the strength of the attack. Jessica's all-out punch would be bounced back onto her. 
,"...The more all-out she went, the more suicidal it would be for Jessica. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I-I get it, ...I know that......"" "
Ronove,"""I am warning you. Stop this now. This is for your own good."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Stop bluffing. Your wall is already about to break, right...? I can tell by the feel of it after punching it so much, okay......?"" "
Ronove,"""............"" "
,That was...a fact. Ronove's wall was already on the verge of breaking. 
,"And on top of that, Jessica's fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive strength defied the imagination. "
,"...In the worst case, that destructive power might even pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well, and create an expansion connecting this room to the next. "
,"...However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well. She wouldn't escape unharmed! "
Ronove,"""I will say it just one more time. Stop. I say this out of consideration for you!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Shut the fuck up... ......Prepare yourself."" "
,"Jessica howled. ...Putting all the strength of her greatest and final destructive power into her fist, she roared... "
,"The three goats had been beaten down long ago. Without straining to breathe in the slightest, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap. "
,...He was after her. He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike... 
,"Gaap was also aiming for a single strike. ......If she let that chance slide, she would be killed this time... "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Aren't you going to use your pitfalls?"" "
Gaap,"""......Ack..."" "
,Even the tiny opening during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal with George as an opponent right now. 
,"...Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them... "
Ushiromiya George,"""......If you won't come, I will."" "
Gaap,"""...G-Go ahead... There's no point in cheap tricks anymore. ...I'll settle it... with this kick of mine!"" "
,"For an instant, she thought George's body blurred, ...and then only his jacket was floating in the air. "
,"The moment she thought ""Ah-"", darkness covered Gaap. "
,"George, with his heel swung up high, was attacking from the sky like a massive dragon. "
Gaap,"""I-It worked... ...This is my victory, Ushiromiya George!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""What?"" "
,"Gaap opened a vast pitfall with her in the center, swallowing up George along with herself...!! "
,The two were swallowed up by the pitfall...and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor. 
,"But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly. ...However, there was another pitfall in George's landing spot. "
Gaap,"""Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhahahahahahahahahaha!!! Gotcha, Ushiromiya Geoooooooooorge!!"" "
Gaap,"""It was fun, so die. The Ushiromiya Family Headship would be wasted on the likes of you, so I'll finish you right here, right now!!! Aaaaaahhhhh, nngaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"" "
,George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor. He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two story building. 
,"In the sky, he couldn't control his posture in any way. It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!! "
,"As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel. "
,"...This was the final strike...to perform his requiem. The final strike of the queen bee that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!! "
Gaap,"""Welcome to the Abyss!! This is the end of the line for you!!!"" "
,She closed in on her prey...and stuck her foot up into the sky. 
,"...At that time, she saw George's face. ......Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his right hand. "
,"And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick. Without the faintest deviation, he aimed for Gaap's forehead... "
Ushiromiya George,"""......I had already hypothesized that this move would come up."" "
Gaap,"""......Wh...at......?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""If I'd jumped to make the person that was {i:on the ground} taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago. ......However, my posture hasn't collapsed in the slightest. Do you know why?"" "
Gaap,"""......You... don't... mean..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""From the very beginning, ...I aimed to make a person two stories below taste my heel!!!"" "
Gaap,"""Uu, ...oooooooooooooohhh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's your loss, Miss!!!"" "
Gaap,"""Bing‐bong."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Whooooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss!!!"" "
,Jessica's last and strongest upwards punch... reached the wall... and was sucked in. 
,"It was sucked into a black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall. "
Ronove,"""Well, ......I did tell you to stop."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""This......is......"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Gu, ......ah..."" "
Gaap,"""Actually, ......I wasn't even close to being in a pinch. Sooorry..."" "
,"...Jessica's fist had gone for George's stomach, ...and George's axe kick had lined up on Jessica's head. "
,The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica's fist crushed George's organs and scattered his abdomen. 
,The same destructive power in George's axe kick smashed half of Jessica's head...and scattered its contents in the same manner... 
Gaap,"""Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!! Didn't I tell yooou? About a witch's acting proweeeeeeess? Hey, hey, Beato, what do you think, were you watching...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!! Not bad, just as planned! You really do get it, Gaap!! Woohoo!!"" "
,Beato and Gaap casually high-fived each other. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......hhh... ...aaah, ......whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"" "
Gaap,"""Thanks, Ronove. Thanks for the gift. I'll return Jessica's corpse. ...Separate the corpses of the two who are close. ...Does this mean the second twilight is over?"" "
,"Gaap dropped Jessica's corpse through a pitfall... and all the chunks were thrown into Jessica's room, as carelessly as throwing something into the trash... "
,Jessica's corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room. 
,Ronove shook his head slightly at this gruesome change of scenery. 
Ronove,"""......My apologies, Jessica-sama. I did warn you."" "
Ronove,"""However, ...the true art of us demons...that is, foreseeing this conclusion and giving you advice I knew you wouldn't listen to, really isn't something a Human could understand. ...Pukkukukukukukukukukuku!"" "
Gaap,"""It really was fun, kid. ...But you play with words a bit too much. ...Is ""Maybe it's about time I started fighting back?"" really the best you've got? Heheheh, are you trying to be someone from a light novel or something? *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"" "
,"In the arbor brutally decorated by George's and Jessica's scattered blood and guts, Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while... "
,"...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers. "
,"As she did, a cloud of gold butterflies rose up around her, stuck to each of the bits and blood stains, and dropped them. "
,"...Then, George's corpse returned bit by bit, and the brutal corpse with its guts torn out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping. "
,Was this some act of sportsmanship towards a dead rival......? 
,The heavens were split. 
,"...Because Gaap had lifted her leg high, pointing at the sky. "
Gaap,"""See you, lover boy. This is Game Over for real."" "
,"*splat*. ......Without a trace of mercy, that foot stepped down... and was buried into George's forehead. "
,The stiletto heel that was sharp as a weapon pierced George's forehead. 
,"With a *bloop*, ...it was pulled out... "
,It was like a mark proving that Gaap certainly had finished him by her own hand... 
,"Ronove also returned Jessica's corpse to its original form. ...And unlike how it had been with George, he restored Jessica's life... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Uu, ......*cough*, *cough*... ...What in the world...is this...? ...A dream...?"" "
Ronove,"""No, that is wrong. ...You certainly did pass away, Jessica-sama. You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."" "
,Jessica's mind was burning. 
,"...For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere...and having George's heel smash her head... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Am I...alive...?"" "
Ronove,"""No, you are dead. With my magic, that will only be postponed for a scant three minutes. After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head crushed."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Wh-What'd you say......? ...Heh, ......heheheheh..."" "
Ronove,"""Death is brutal. In most cases, you aren't even given the time to ready your heart. ...But to praise you for fighting so bravely, I've decided to give you this time. Perhaps you should sort out your regrets from this world in those three minutes."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I can also...decide to take you along with me during those three minutes..."" "
,But the power that had burned through Jessica's body until a second ago had been completely lost. 
,...Jessica was aware of that herself. She was already dead. 
Ronove,"""And that is all for me. If you would excuse me. ...It was fun, Jessica-sama."" "
,Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared. 
,"All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica as she crouched down, leaning against the wall... "
,Jessica could tell. She probably really would revert to the corpse she had been after three minutes. 
,...Was there anything she could do in those three minutes......? 
,"She stood up, and with a shaky gait, ...took the phone that was on the desk... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...H-Hello? ...Is that Jessica? Jessica?! What is it, are you okay?!?!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Heh, ...heheheheh... ...They...got me..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Are you okay?! Did you get injured?! I'll come to save you right now!!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""No, ...it's already too late. I'm...already dead, or so I hear... Ahahaha, by the time you got here, Battler, I'd be a corpse with half its head split open."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Craaaaaaap, that damn geezer!! Wait there, I'm coming right now!!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Listen to me, Battler!! Listen closely, okay...? ......Now I totally see why Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were evasive about the time the six in the dining hall got killed. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,""".........Those guys, uh... ......aren't... ...Human."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wh-Whaat?! What are you talking about......?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""What do you want me to say, man, I frigging saw it, okay?!! Those guys, they warp, set up barriers, ahhaha, {i:all} of that crap, y'know...? It's like some manga, some anime, ......seriously, we can't deal with that."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Ahhahhahhah... ...From the very beginning, fighting was useless... They really aren't opponents that you'll be able to fight with that hat-stand spear you're so proud of..."" "
,A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's forehead... 
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""George nii-san's done for too. That was...an instant death... ......Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler. ......I wonder if your test will go the same way as ours... ......Be careful...and don't misunderstand."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Y-You mean about the test...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""No. ......Don't misunderstand... and assume that your enemy's Human. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,......The enemy...isn't Human. ...They're demons...that can freely wield a terrifying magic. 
Ushiromiya Jessica,"No matter what, ...don't get the wrong idea about that... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! Be...careful..."" "
,A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's mouth as well. {n}...The left half of her head started hurting. 
,Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been. 
Ushiromiya Jessica,""".........When 13 people die, the Golden Witch...will revive. Six were killed including Mom. That's the first twilight. ...Then George nii-san and I were killed...for the second twilight. ...So once five more people are killed, the ceremony will be complete, ...and the witch will revive."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......I hope Dad and the rest are safe... ...If they aren't, ......the one to test you... might be the resurrected {f:5:Beatrice} herself..."" "
,"Battler already didn't understand what Jessica was saying. But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die. "
,"So even though he didn't understand the situation, he urged her to give it her all. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Haha, I said I'm already dead. ......See ya. It looks like it's time. ...Good luck on your test. I hope you...can become the Head. ............"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Jessica? Jessica?! Hey, answer me!! Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"" "
,Battler's sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver. 
,"...As she leaned against the wall in that corner, crouched down... ...Jessica's head had been half smashed...... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""This place is...?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Is this...a well...? Where is this...?"" "
,"Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too. When he realized that they could see the back of the mansion from beyond a grove of trees, Krauss knew more or less where they were. "
,"...To think that here, in a certain well, there had been a hidden underground passage, which led to a hidden mansion... "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Th-This really is tough on this old body... ...I usually came up from a different spot, with real stairs. If you just unlock it..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...I will ask you to tell me about the layout of this place in detail later, Doctor Nanjo. ...Shannon, are you okay? Grab hold."" "
Shannon,"""...I-I'm fine. Kanon-kun, quickly."" "
,Kanon climbed up a ladder out of the shaft that was disguised as a well. ...It was probably quite deep. 
,"When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he'd come up. "
Chiester410,"""Nihi. Firing."" "
,*bang*. 
,"......As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest. "
,...Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon's chest to the scenery beyond... 
Shannon,"""......K-Kanon-kun!!!"" "
Kanon,"""......Ne... ...e-sa... ......"" "
,Kanon slumped backwards... and was swallowed up into the depths of the well... 
Shannon,"""E-Everyone, run!! The Chiester Sisters!! They've locked on, we can't avoid them!! Run!! Let at least one of us remain alive...!!!"" "
,"At that time, Krauss and Kyrie and Nanjo... certainly saw a golden curved line appear from the well... and sew itself through the side of Shannon's head...... "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Shannon!!!"" "
,"Her head had been pierced. The three had witnessed it perfectly until it had shot out the opposite side, blowing it away. "
,"Shannon fell to her knees, ......blood gushing from both sides of her head, and flopped to the ground. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""W-Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""They're after us!! Run!! We'll be killed!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...R-Run, ...runrunrun!!!"" "
,"As Nanjo doubled over in shock, stunned by how Shannon had died, the Chiester Sisters did not allow him to escape. "
,"A curved line again appeared from the well...and pierced from Nanjo's forehead to the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him. "
,"...*thump*. And so, Nanjo passed away. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""What the, why...?!! Where's the enemy coming from?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""We're being sniped!! I don't know where from, but they've honed in on us perfectly!! Let's escape into the mansion, block their field of vision!!"" "
,The two dashed towards the back door of the mansion. 
,"Then, right as Krauss was about to shut the door behind him, "
,"...a golden curved line appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head to his forehead and smashing that forehead... "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""............nngg... ......oooh......"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Eeek!! Eeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"" "
,"Krauss's body leaned over, fell down, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head... "
,"Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door. "
,"......But even so, she wasn't even remotely convinced that this had saved her life. "
,She would probably die soon! 
,"This was apparently one of the guest rooms. ...At that moment, Kyrie's eyes fell on a phone on a side table... "
,"After hanging up the call from Jessica, Batter had been about to dash out. "
,"In that instant, the phone rang again. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""H-Hello!!! ......Huh? Kyrie-san?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Yes, Battler-kun. ...I got lucky. I managed to escape the dungeon somehow. I really did have luck on my side."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Where are you?! Is everyone okay?! Over here, it looks like Jessica and George-aniki are-"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Listen!!! I probably won't be alive for long."" "
,"At that time, right after she thought the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold, a gold, curved line drawing a helix... no, a golden sewing thread penetrated in from there at an incredible speed and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie's feet. "
,"...Oh, that's unusual. "
,"The enemy, who sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill, apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I'm holed up in this room. "
,But the next strike will probably hit... 
,"At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the first massive killing in the dining hall... "
,"...That's right... ...This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Listen, Battler-kun. I'm going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it. ...I'm sure you'll think there's something wrong with my head. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"...Yes, it's okay for you think that. Even I still haven't sorted out what it was I saw."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Today, after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall, ...and I'll tell you everything that happened next. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"Listen until the end without butting in. ......The call might be suddenly cut off partway through. If it does, at that time, I'll be dead."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Kyrie...san..."" "
,"Then, Kyrie spoke... ...about Kinzo appearing and the family conference starting, ...about the six being killed and the five of them being confined... "
,"...About how she had escaped somehow...and ran away to where she was now, and how everyone had finally been killed... It was all spoken dispassionately, with no dramatization, just as she'd seen it. "
,"...She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths, ...and how even now, someone was trying to kill her. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Actually, even while we've been talking, ...I've been attacked three times. Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"First it was by my feet. ...Next, it was close to my shoulders. ...Just now, it grazed my ear. ...Its aim is getting more and more accurate. Looks like it'll go right between my eyes pretty soon..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""R-Run, Kyrie-san...!! Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Where to? ......You realize, ...I've managed to run all the way here, ...shut myself into a room, and even locked the door, right...? ......Now that I'm still being pursued, ......just where should I hide, ...hey..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ky...... ri... e... ...san......"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Hey, Battler-kun... Are Jessica-chan and George-kun...still alive?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...... ...Not long ago, ...I got a phone call from Jessica... ......It kinda...sounded like they were...done for..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Thought so. ...Yeah, when we were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition. I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the ceremony of killing 13 people...before our twilights had been reached. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"......In short, when I die, that's 13 people. This way, the ceremony is complete. ...The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, will resurrect."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I wonder what in the world will happen. ...On this island filled with demons and witches...and swarming with goat monsters, ...I wonder just what will happen... ...when even the leader of them all, the Golden Witch, appears... ...By now, I don't... ...have a clue what's going on anymore."" "
,Kyrie-san's voice...had completely given up on her own life. 
,"Because Battler understood that, ...he couldn't stop the tears... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...There's just one thing...I can advise you on."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......If... a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""There's no need whatsoever to doubt whether it's real or not. ...Understand that it is what it seems to be."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You might think there must be some trick, or that there's some true nature hidden behind it. ...If you have the time to think of something like that, ...it'd be much more constructive to plan out how not to damage the mood of whatever you're facing. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"...Even mistakenly, ...you must not say ""In that case, try showing me magic""... ...Because to prove that, they'll probably use an even crueler way than before... ...to show you."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I can't... ...believe it... ...Even if I hear... ...something like that coming from your mouth, ...I can't believe it......"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I understand. I understand why you can't believe. ...So, that's why I can give this advice. ......{i:Believe}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You're telling me to believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...and demons and witches and monsters...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Probably, ......even after being so clearly shown all those things not of this world, ...I think we still weren't able to believe any of it. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"I'm still like that now. ...The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead, ...is something I don't understand, ......and I can't believe it."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""So, ...I want you alone to believe, to understand, ......to accept the existence... ...of what we couldn't accept. If you do that for me, our deaths won't be wasted. ......It'll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call... ...Ah...!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""K-Kyrie-san?!?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I'm still okay. It scratched me, but it missed again. ...It looks like... ...I probably won't get another chance. ......Thank you. And goodbye, Battler-kun. I treated you coldly sometimes because you were Asumu-san's son. ...Forgive me...for those days."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What do you mean, forgive you? Right now, you are a mother to me, Kyrie-san!!"" "
,"I felt as though I'd heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver. Then, a noisy clacking sound. "
,...As though the receiver had fallen to the floor. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Kyrie-san?!?! Kyrie-san!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"" "
,.........Kyrie‐san never... ......answered through the phone...... ...again......
