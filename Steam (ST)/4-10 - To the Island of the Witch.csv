Speaker,Steam (ST)
,"I had planned on taking a nap, ...but the boat really was shaking bad. "
,"I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck. There, I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze... "
,Amakusa had been doing some stretches on the deck. 
,"...He must have a lot of time on his hands too. After all, it'll be several more hours before we reach Niijima. "
,"It would only have taken a couple dozen minutes by airplane, but there was the chance that the Niijima airport was under the Sumadera family's web. "
,"The harbor would probably be the same. For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, no questions asked. "
,"I'd bumped into a cheery boat captain, treated him generously, and he had decided to help me out, amused... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Still gonna be a while?"" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it'll take a full two hours more. Well, beggars can't be choosers."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......The weather sure is nice. Feels like I'll burn."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Going to read on the deck? You'll damage your book."" "
,Amakusa apparently thought this because I was clutching Maria onee-chan's diary under my arm. 
,"I'd been reading it half asleep, which was why I'd come back up still clutching it. "
Amakusa Juuza,"""How's it going? Think you'll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria-san's diary?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Who knows. No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won't make for anything more than a theory. There's no truth written in the message bottle or Onee-chan's diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around. ...I'm stuck."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Looks like you've got nothing to look forward to except questioning those involved on Niijima."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I imagine the Witch Hunters have showered them with questions over and over, so I'm pretty sure I won't find any new facts."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Hehhaha...! So even though your hopes are that low, you're willing to spend a half-day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! Talk about fickle."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......It's like a journey of self-satisfaction, so that I can say ""I investigated"". I'm not so naive as to seriously think that the truth of 12 years ago will be revealed."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""And when you're done with your self-satisfaction trip, what'll you do next?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Who knows. I haven't thought about it. ......I'll go to Niijima, ask some people who were involved. ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."" "
,......Several days have already passed since this journey began. 
,"After being told by {f:5:Bernkastel} on the roof of that building to search for the truth of 12 years ago, I'd left on a journey like trying to grasp a cloud. "
,"At the time, I felt as though I'd experienced something mystical...and had the feeling that I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey. "
,"...But after several days passed, my excitement died down. "
,"On that day, when I stood on the roof of that skyscraper, my heart was completely cornered and dead. "
,...So I'd wanted from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky... and had crossed the fence in order to die. 
,"Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down... caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch. "
,"......The excitement from my jump lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning. "
,But I didn't even consider suspending this journey just because of that. 
,"If I stop this journey, it'll mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion. "
,And I felt as though that meant throwing away the promise the witch made... and any chance that someone from my family might come back. 
,"So, because it was hard to believe that those events were an illusion, I've continued on my journey. "
,I don't seriously believe that this journey will change anything. ...It's even up to me when to end this journey. It's up to me to choose where the final destination is. 
,"In the end, this journey is only for my self-satisfaction... "
Amakusa Juuza,"""......Self-satisfaction, huh? It sounds bad when you say it, but I think that's actually what life is all about."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Oh? If that's the answer you've reached after hovering over the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that's probably pretty deep."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Don't take it so lightly. What I'm trying to say...is that the only one who can acknowledge you in this world is you yourself."" "
,Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke. In an irritatingly fresh way. 
,"Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......... ...That may be true. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"People work hard when they want to be acknowledged by someone. ...In most cases, that someone is their parents. Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents. ......Although that's why I never learned."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Sorry, that's not how I meant it. "
Amakusa Juuza,"...What I'm trying to say is that there's nothing wrong with self-satisfaction. No matter who praises you, it's meaningless unless you can accept it. ...Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn't matter as long as you can accept it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Self-satisfaction tends to contradict a desire to improve oneself, so we're usually taught that it's bad. Somehow, your argument seems like a pretty fresh take on it, Amakusa."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""The anguish of the human world comes when you want someone to acknowledge you, but you don't know what it is you should be striving for. I had a time like that too. "
Amakusa Juuza,"I wanted to be acknowledged by someone, but I didn't know what I wanted them to acknowledge about me. And since I didn't know what to strive for or how far I should go to be acknowledged, I did a lot of crazy things."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""And the answer you reached...was self-satisfaction?"" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""It sounds bad, but that's how it is. Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""......If I'm satisfied with my life, it doesn't matter what other people say. It's the same for your life, and for this journey. No one has any right to criticize you other than you yourself, Ange-san."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""You're the only one who determines the meaning and results of your journey. If it's been a meaningful journey for you, then that's more than enough."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......... ......I always did take you for a flippant ladies man, but you really do say weird things every once in a while. I'll bet you think saying stuff like that will make you popular."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Of course not, of course not. That's not how I meant it at all. ......Looks like you want to be alone. I'll head over to see the boat captain. Please, take it easy."" "
,Amakusa apparently decided I was in a bad mood. ...Although I didn't feel that way myself. 
,"Or, he might have finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade. "
,"The sea winds were strong, but not enough to cool the rays of the sun. "
,Amakusa disappeared. Only I remained. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Self-satisfaction is life itself, huh?"" "
Mammon,"""That's just boring. Life is nothing without greed."" "
,"I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her abundant hair fluttering over by the prow of the ship. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's true that a life of greed would be fun. But unlike you, Humans have a limited life-span. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"If greed is eternal, that means a person will have desires even in the last moment before they die. Having desires means there's something that you want. Something you don't have, some way you aren't complete."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...I'm sure it's tough to die when you can't think of your life as being a full one. So I'm sure self-satisfaction is necessary."" "
Mammon,"""......I see. Because of the existence of a life span, you have to compromise like that? All of my masters had very long life spans, so I've never thought of it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I wonder if Humans live for the purpose of becoming satisfied. ...If so, it's probably easiest to live without desires. ...I see, so that's why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."" "
Mammon,"""*giggle* Your praise honors me."" "
,Apparently that counted as a compliment in Mammon's eyes. She turned and gave a graceful bow. 
Mammon,"""Ange-sama, do Humans live so that they can find satisfaction at the moment of their deaths?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Wouldn't it be pretty tough if you felt you were lacking something when you died?"" "
Mammon,"""If so, then Humans live only so that they can meet a satisfying death. They live so that they can have a better death. They live so that they can die."" "
,"......This kid's saying something pretty incredible. ...I see, as I'd expect from a demon stake. "
,"However, it might be the truth. Humans suffer because they aren't satisfied...and live only to find satisfaction. "
,"In other words, that might be the same as a desire to die satisfied. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I can't counter that. ...People live in order to be satisfied. And they hope to die that way. So, it's really painful when you don't know how to find that satisfaction."" "
Mammon,"""Just how can you find something like that? In a Human's life."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......By being acknowledged. By hearing someone say ""You are happy""."" "
Mammon,"""If it doesn't matter who acknowledges them, then I'll do it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah, that's the problem. ......People don't know who needs to acknowledge them."" "
Mammon,"""So, searching for this person who can acknowledge them is the journey of their life? Hmmmm."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It sounds strange. Whether you're acknowledged or not, it supposedly doesn't change your circumstances. ...And yet, if you are acknowledged, you will be satisfied, while if you aren't, then you won't. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"...It's almost like the blue bird. ...Because you can't notice the blue bird even though it's already in the cage, you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."" "
Mammon,"""What the heck. Kyahhahaha. Human lives sure are stupid."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's right. Amakusa said something really good. ...Rich is the one who is content with what they are, ...was it? I don't know where that proverb came from, but it's deep. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"...Basically, if you can't find enough satisfaction unless someone else acknowledges you, that's the same as not acknowledging yourself. ...The ultimate in self-fulfillment is acknowledging yourself."" "
Mammon,"""That's right. Because, if you can ""know"" that you're fully satisfied, there's no need to be acknowledged by anyone. Just by taking notice of the small things, the Humans' foolish journey of life can be ended easily. "
Mammon,"You can spend the rest of your life playing and having a good time. A Human's life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"" "
,"Mammon's choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth. "
,"If most of a Human's life is a journey with the hopes that someone will acknowledge them, so that they can achieve a satisfied death... "
,"......Then when they realize that the person doing the acknowledging isn't someone else, but they themselves, that pointless journey can end. "
,"Humans who have ended that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish, with their heads held high. "
,"How noble, how praiseworthy would that be... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You know, it seems Amakusa's on pretty bad terms with his parents. ...That makes sense. Any decent parents would want him to get the hell out of the trade he's in."" "
Mammon,"""Does that really matter though? As long as it's fun for the person in question."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Exactly. That's what it comes down to in the end. Criticism formed by the observations of other people doesn't matter. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"If your existence is firmly acknowledged by you yourself, that's enough. ...If you can live with confidence in yourself, you'll surely be able to accept and be satisfied with any kind of lifestyle."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured. ...He might even die. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"But I don't think he'd view that as something unfair. I'm sure he'd cackle about how that's also part of life."" "
Mammon,"""What a great way to live. I could fall for the guy."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Pitiful Humans who can't acknowledge themselves... wander about searching for that their whole lives, and without anything being accepted, they do nothing but grumble and die while still unsatisfied. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"...How pitiful. Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose, Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he's much more noble for living his life with his head held high."" "
Mammon,"""Aren't the winners in life those who achieve enlightenment? If they can do that even a little sooner, they'll be able to live that much more of their life effectively."" "
,"......With Mammon's words, ...I finally accepted a certain fact. "
,"In the past, ...I've called that girl unusual, a little strange. "
,"However, ...that wasn't true. "
,All she did was keep her head held high... ...and finish that journey faster than anyone else. 
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Maybe that's what made Maria onee-chan...so amazing. When she was at the age where she might or might not enter the first year of elementary school, she had already reached that point."" "
,"For people like us, looking at her life from the outside, it wasn't something we'd call blessed. "
,"But even though days like that were engraved in her diary, ...they always finished up by saying that it was a happy day. "
,"Even though the part of her mother that didn't love her daughter came and went, she believed that her mother loved her. "
,"The mother's love that didn't exist, she created herself, filling her world with love. "
,"Others might observe her as an unsatisfied, pitiful girl, ...but she herself acknowledged that she was satisfied. "
,"And so, she was happy that way. "
,"It's easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad. But to her, that was an outsider's opinion, so it didn't matter. "
,"""Whether or not it was happy for her""...was the only important thing. "
,"It's just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in rural areas, and mourn their inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it's really none of their business. "
,"If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that's more than enough. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I've finally noticed something. I noticed it just now. ...I did something horrible to Maria onee-chan. ......And to you all and Sakutarou as well, on that day."" "
Mammon,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Whether magic exists...or not. ...That's not up to other people to decide. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"It's up to you yourself. Whether magic exists to Maria onee-chan is a problem for Maria onee-chan to decide, not me."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...And yet, when I was young, on that day, I said it. By saying there was no way magic exists, ...I hurt her."" "
,The fact that magic doesn't exist in my eyes...matters in my world. But denying it even in Onee-chan's world for that reason was totally misguided. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Mariage Sorcière is the Witches' Alliance Maria onee-chan created. I was invited into it...and told to become a witch with them."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thinking it a new, interesting game, I went along with that for a while. ...But, because of the cruelty of youth, I got tired of it half-way through. And, ...I tore her pure heart apart with sharp words."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...At that time, we must've gotten into a huge fight. I forgot about it right away, but she couldn't forget about it. ...After all, to her, magic was a natural power that really existed, and she believed that she'd be able to share it with me."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...To Maria onee-chan, magic is a power that can interpret the world as blessed...no, which can truly make everything blessed. She just wanted to share that with me too. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"The young me tore that feeling apart. ...So, she closed herself up in a shell, assuming that she wouldn't be able to share her magic with anyone."" "
Mammon,"""......If that's true, then Lady {f:5:Maria}'s journey through life wasn't over after all. If she'd been able to accept herself, then there'd be no need to collapse just because you denied her, Ange-sama."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Onee-chan was young. She still hadn't reached a philosophical viewpoint like Amakusa. ...Yeah, now I understand... That's why the witches' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary."" "
,——An alliance where each acknowledges that the other is a witch. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...That's right, I'm pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière. ...Witches of the alliance would acknowledge each other and respect each other. That's the deepest and only meaning of the witches' alliance..."" "
,"Maria onee-chan wanted to share with me the secret laws to make the world happy, called magic. "
,But I was young. And she was too. 
,...I hurt her with innocent cruelty. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......On that day, I said...cruel things. To you all and Sakutarou. I said there was no way you exist."" "
Mammon,"""How rude. We acknowledge that we exist ourselves. We're not like Humans, with their souls half-asleep. ...""I think, therefore I am"". "
Mammon,"Whether you acknowledge or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is a fact. ...As long as we acknowledge it ourselves, to borrow your words."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny it. ......I'm sure that'd be like having your true mother yell ""I wish you had never been born""... no, ""Disappear""."" "
,"...Even after being slammed by all those words, ...Maria onee-chan's magic... ...made her believe in her mother's love. "
,"Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her. "
,"...He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work, and that she would definitely bring back a present... "
,"Even after Maria learned that her mother's work wasn't really the cause, magic allowed her to continue believing. "
,"And by believing that her mother loved her, by acknowledging herself, she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ...establishing it completely. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What happened 12 years ago, ...what happened to my family... ...This was never...a journey to search for that."" "
Mammon,"""......Then what kind of journey is this?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It was a journey...to apologize to Maria onee-chan for what happened that day."" "
Mammon,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't know why, but that's what I think. ...If I hadn't hurt her, ......the incident 12 years ago might not have occurred. ...That's what I think."" "
,I have no basis for it. I don't have a clue how hurting Onee-chan could be connected with that mysterious incident several years later. 
,"But, for some reason, I can't imagine that there's no connection. "
,A witch caused that incident. 
,"And the culprit is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. "
,And {f:5:Beatrice} was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches. 
,I horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance. 
,I hurt her with the thought that magic doesn't exist. 
,"......So, several years later, a crime caused by a witch occurred, and a two-day period that couldn't be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face, thanks to the message bottle. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...There's no way I wasn't involved somehow. ......I don't get it. It could be coincidence, or it could be fate. ......For some reason, I've starting thinking like that on this journey."" "
Mammon,"""And what's your basis for it?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I have none. I just think it's true."" "
Mammon,"""Hmmmm... The Japanese sure are interesting. Even when they're the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong and apologize for no reason. "
Mammon,"...I could understand if you said ""I hate {f:5:Beatrice} for stealing my family!"" or something, but you really are weird, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Of course I hate {f:5:Beatrice}. I couldn't continue this journey without that feeling. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"But it's okay to choose yet another purpose for this journey. There's nothing wrong with adding on a goal of apologizing for past sins, in addition to getting revenge on a witch for what happened 12 years ago. I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...No, ......there's something better than flowers. And I think that would be more fitting for Onee-chan."" "
,"I stood up, not minding that the sea breeze scattered my hair, and concentrated my mind... "
,I lifted my palm up to the height of my head...and imagined a vast space... 
Mammon,"""......Ange-sama, ........."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Be quiet. ......... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"...Come, arise. ...I am the witch apprentice, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}. ...I was excommunicated, but I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are the dearly-missed furniture who played with me. Answer to my call......"" "
,"It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palm of my hand. "
,"......Then, ......Sakutarou's form was revived. "
,"It truly did bring back memories, that figure. "
,"His cute ears, his bright-red muffler. "
,"...It came off easily, so Onee-chan faithfully re-wrapped it all the time, didn't she...? "
Mammon,"""...Sakutaro, ...do you recognize us? Do you know who we are...?"" "
Sakutarou,‘...Uryu...? Uryu...? Mammon...? Ange......?’ 
,"With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's been a long time, ...Sakutarou. I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've summoned you with my own power. ...And now, I'm the only one who can summon you."" "
Sakutarou,‘.........Uryu...’ 
,Those words might have been a bit cruel. Sakutarou's face clouded over... 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""In the past, I denied you. ......Now that I've summoned you, ...it means I've accepted your existence."" "
Sakutarou,‘......Are you sure...? Is it really all right...for me to be summoned into Ange's world...?’ 
,His eyes were a bit frightened. 
,"...It was only natural. I, who had played with him like a friend before, had suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the magic-resisting toxin. "
,It was only natural that he was scared... 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I apologize... for that day. ......To you too, Mammon. And to the rest of you."" "
,"At some point, ...the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck. "
,"No, they're always there. Always by my side. "
,"As long as I acknowledge that it's okay for them to be there, they'll always appear. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You certainly do exist. Lucifer. And Leviathan. And Satan. And Belphegor. And Mammon. And Beelzebub. And Asmodeus. ...And Sakutarou too."" "
Lucifer,"""...Are you sure? You're one challenging {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, Ange-sama. ...Is it okay for one in a position of denying witches to acknowledge us?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""As to whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that on hold. It's not like I myself acknowledged the existence of magic."" "
Leviathan,"""...But then, doesn't that contradict the fact...that you're acknowledging us?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's because magic exists for people who believe. Even if I don't. If someone believes, then magic will exist in the human world."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That fact won't change in the slightest whether I believe in magic or not. No, it mustn't change. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"That person just had to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic. I acknowledge that. So, it wouldn't be strange at all for all of you to exist."" "
Satan,"""......Quite a play on words, ...but it's an interesting interpretation."" "
Belphegor,"""What you're saying, Ange-sama, is probably a Devil's Proof."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""A Devil's Proof...?"" "
Beelzebub,"""Right?! To prove the existence of demons, you just need to find one."" "
Asmodeus,"""But it's impossible to deny the existence of demons."" "
Mammon,"""Kyahha! And we're here. That means that whether Ange-sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."" "
Sakutarou,‘...Uryu? The magic-resisting toxin... ...is disappearing... ...from Ange...’ 
Mammon,"""Y-You're right... ...Even though you're in a position of denying magic, ...why...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's probably... ...because I learned what it means to respect and acknowledge. Right now, ...I might be able... to understand the depths of Maria onee-chan's...and {f:5:Beatrice}'s magic."" "
,"In the past, I didn't believe in things like magic. Thinking something like that couldn't exist, I acted like I was closing my eyes tightly and couldn't see anything. "
,"But now, I'm different. I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic...and close in on its true nature... "
Satan,"""...How frustrating. It's truly rare to find a Human so free of the magic-resisting toxin in this day and age. And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."" "
Leviathan,"""That's right. ...If Ange-sama tried to become a witch right now, ...she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's level."" "
Belphegor,"""Even so, she has acknowledged our existence and is our master. ...Most likely, Ange-sama will be our final master. Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."" "
Beelzebub,"""...Ble-ah. But I just can't staaand that Ange-sama still doesn't believe in magic herself."" "
Asmodeus,"""...Ange-sama, please believe in magic toooo. It feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wiiitch."" "
Mammon,"""Even though you have outstanding talent that could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to attack witches. It's so frustrating. "
Mammon,"...Well, even so, that's your life, the way you live, and in the world where you've decided that, there's nothing we can do to complain."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thanks for understanding me. Yeah, whether magic exists {i:to me} or not, that's up to me to decide. Regardless of whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not."" "
,"When I think about it, this world is so vast...and yet so small. "
,Billions of people live on the earth. But I probably won't meet even 1% of those people. 
,"Even so, I will speak of a world. ""My world"", which doesn't know even 1% of the world. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don't know. ...So just because magic doesn't exist in my world, I can't deny that magic exists in a world I don't know. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"That makes it a true Devil's Proof. No, maybe it's more like ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do""."" "
,"I can be confident in the world I know. So even if that's denied by a complete stranger who doesn't know a thing about my world, that's nothing to worry about. "
,"And in the same way, I've got no right to deny a world I don't know... just because I don't know about it. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Therefore, regardless of whether there's magic in my world or not, ...I can't deny the magic Maria onee-chan taught me."" "
Sakutarou,"‘Uryu! After all, even if you've never seen it, ...magic exists!’ "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yes. That's why, as I've already said, ...you friends of the witches' alliance, Mariage Sorcière, can't be denied by me or anyone else."" "
,I proclaimed that most important part again. 
,"......Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence. "
,Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...reflected upon my words. 
,"And, probably, I did too. "
,Does magic exist? Do witches exist? 
,"While ignoring what the answer would be for my own world, ...I acknowledged their existence. That contradiction was what I'd proclaimed so boldly. "
Sakutarou,"‘Thank you, ...Ange.’ "
Belphegor,"""If you'll acknowledge that much, can't you acknowledge witches too...? ...No, that was a foolish question. You already have a clear answer to it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Sorry. Though, I do acknowledge that witches might exist somewhere in this world. But that doesn't shake my world."" "
Mammon,"""...You won't acknowledge witches or magic. You'll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima. ...Right?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yes. That's my world. Even if a real witch exists, I won't acknowledge it in my world. No matter how much that witch tries to convince me."" "
Lucifer,"""Your position is to attack witches, Ange-sama. ...And I understand well that you haven't the slightest wavering in that feeling. "
Lucifer,"We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...! We will always be by your side. We'll always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"" "
Leviathan,"""Although, since you don't believe in magic, we can never be anything more than people to talk to."" "
Satan,"""That's enough for now. We've been left room to exist. For that alone, we should thank and acknowledge Ange-sama."" "
Beelzebub,"""In short! All of us!"" "
Sakutarou,‘Are all together again... Uryu-!!’ 
Asmodeus,"""Kya-h!! Sakutaro-! Let me squeeze youuuuuuuuu-!!"" "
,"When Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him. "
,...They were also celebrating a long-missed reunion. 
,"If their existence is permitted, they're definitely capable of existing here. "
,"No, even if I don't permit it, they can exist. "
,"Because I acknowledged them, they {i:showed their reuinon's joy} to me as well. "
,"As I watched over that scene, ......I reflected over what this journey of mine meant. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."" "
Mammon,"""You've done enough. We are furniture. Just being summoned, just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."" "
Sakutarou,"‘Uryu...! Ange, thank you very much...!’ "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou? ...No, it's the other way around. Why wasn't Onee-chan able to summon Sakutarou?"" "
,"Maria onee-chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died. "
,Which meant she hadn't been able to summon him like this anymore. 
,"In the past, Onee-chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel. "
,"However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn't be absolutely necessary. "
,"...In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou's vessel didn't exist, it should've be possible to summon him. "
,"...No, when you put it like that, it's even a little doubtful whether summoned things can be limited by life and death. "
,"Moreover, Sakutarou should have been an especially important friend to Maria onee-chan. "
,She should've been able to strive hard to summon him one more time. 
,"It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart, but why did he ""die"" and become impossible to summon again...? "
Sakutarou,"‘...That's because... ...at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal torn... and {i:decided} that I'd died.’ "
Mammon,"""It's the same as the existence of magic. ...If Sakutarou has died in Lady {f:5:Maria}'s world, then he can't exist in her world."" "
Sakutarou,‘......Uryu...’ 
,The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart... had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from summoning her irreplaceable close friend. 
,"{i:In Maria onee‐chan's eyes}, Sakutarou had died. "
,"So even if Sakutarou can exist like this to me, he cannot exist before her. "
Sakutarou,"‘I...was always with Maria... ...When Maria cried, I was always right beside her, telling her not to cry... ...But my form, my voice, ...nothing of me will reach Maria now...’ "
,"Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change. Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"But after that incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate. ...Onee-chan's diary began to show a clear change."" "
,A diary is a mirror that reflects one's heart as it is. 
,"It probably showed the personality called Maria die...... and be reborn as the evil witch personality, {f:5:Maria}. "
,"When she buried that diary in hatred and sadness, ...her heart surely wasn't satisfied. "
,"Because it wasn't satisfied, she had to bury it with hatred and sadness. "
,"And while still unsatisfied, she met with death. "
,"...I wonder if her unsatisfied soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now... and continually wanders, dripping tears down and calling Sakutarou's name... "
,............ 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Onee-chan...needs you."" "
Sakutarou,‘Uryu......’ 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What can I do to revive you in Maria onee-chan's world? If I can learn that method, I'll be able to save Onee-chan. ...That's the method of atonement I've been given. What can be done to revive Sakutarou?"" "
Sakutarou,"‘...To Maria, my vessel had a very important meaning...’ "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The vessel. ...In other words, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."" "
Sakutarou,"‘But... ...Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only she could make it...’ "
,"Even inside the diary, Maria onee-chan had asked this of {f:5:Beatrice}...and was refused for that reason. "
,The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large. 
,"Then, if we could make the same thing once more... "
,But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world. We can't make the same thing again. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"" "
Mammon,"""He's a stuffed animal made to be Lady {f:5:Maria}'s birthday present...and is the only one of his kind in the world. ...A handmade and unique vessel. That's why it conceals a great magical power. "
Mammon,"And, ...if lost, it cannot be obtained again. It won't revive..."" "
Sakutarou,‘......Uryu......’ 
,"...Because she knew that, Maria onee-chan watched that stuffed animal, which was unique in that world, get torn apart, ......and despaired. "
,"Because it was the only one of its kind in the world, and she couldn't permit a compromise such as buying another one, ...she had despaired from the bottom of her heart... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...But Sakutarou is right here. Even without a vessel, he's here. Because I acknowledge that, he certainly exists in my world. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"......Even if Maria onee-chan doesn't acknowledge him, that cannot be denied. Right...?"" "
Mammon,"""Logically, that's true, ...but I think using the same logic to make Lady {f:5:Maria} accept him could be difficult."" "
Sakutarou,"‘...Maria, ...I'm not dead... I'm right here...... ...Uryu...’ "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm sure that on Rokkenjima, ...I'll be able to be reunited with Maria onee-chan. And, ...no matter what, I'll revive the you that's inside Onee-chan...and let you be reunited."" "
Sakutarou,‘Can you do it...?’ 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It'll probably be hard. ...Just like how, after being invited into the witches' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant, she might also reject your existence."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......But, I've got to do it. That's the only way I can atone for my sins."" "
Mammon,"""......Ange-sama..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What's waiting on Rokkenjima? And what will happen, what will be created? ...Or maybe nothing will happen."" "
Sakutarou,‘............’ 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That island, which was the beginning of everything, is the final destination of this journey. ......You all are the furniture of a witch, so as your master, I have to {i:take you home}, to the witch's island, to Rokkenjima."" "
,"Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang down. "
,The spray that hit my cheek might not all have come from crashing waves. 
Amakusa Juuza,"""Ange-san, looks like we're gonna get a bit of a shower. Maybe you'd better go below deck."" "
,"Amakusa called out to me with an expression that said ""Oh, you're still here?"" "
,"When I looked up, I saw that the island's silhouette had gotten much larger. We might reach land very soon. "
,I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains. 
,The sky wasn't dark enough for rain clouds. It'll probably be just for a short time. 
,Even though the rain was light enough not to be a pain... ...Having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate. 
,"It was raining on October 4, 1986 as well. I'm approaching the Rokkenjima of that day...and not just in distance... "
,I went back down with Amakusa. 
,He was carrying what looked like a really large and heavy golf bag. 
,"It was something Amakusa had brought back with him on a day when we'd split up. ...I didn't inquire as to its contents, but it was hard to imagine that they were anything peaceful. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I won't go so far as to ask what's inside, but it looks heavy."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""Why are these things so darn heavy all the time? A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once. "
Amakusa Juuza,"He said they should always be heavy. ......After all, a human life is heavier than the world. So these should be even heavier."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......It'd be nice if you didn't need to use them."" "
Amakusa Juuza,"""That would be nice."" "
,Amakusa set the golf bag-like luggage down beside him. 
,"A two-propeller aircraft touched down on the runway. Considering the weather, it couldn't have been a pleasant flight. Everything after this flight had been suspended due to weather. "
,"Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black-suits as guards. "
,The four black-suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads in salute. 
,"""""""Kasumi-sama...!!"""""" "
Sumadera Kasumi,"""Propeller planes certainly do shake... I wouldn't want to ride one again."" "
,"""We have a car prepared! Please, this way."" "
,They got into two luxury cars that had been rented... 
Sumadera Kasumi,"""...Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima. A deserted island... How convenient. ......You've arranged for some tools, I take it?"" "
,"""Yes Ma'am...!"" "
,"The black-suit in the passenger seat put a heavy bag that had been set by his feet onto his lap, opened the catch with a *click*, and showed Kasumi what was inside. "
,Inside were several silver lumps of carefully wrapped aluminum foil. 
,...He peeled one open to show her. 
,"A black, blunt automatic pistol peeked its face out... "
