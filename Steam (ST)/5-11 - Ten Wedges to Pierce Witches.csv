Speaker,Steam (ST)
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Father, ...it's Natsuhi. Good morning..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""There's no way he'll wake up if you do it like that! Father, it's Eva! Please wake up! It's an emergency!!"" "
,Eva pushed Natsuhi aside and knocked repeatedly with all her strength. 
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Q-Quiet down...!! You're being too boisterous...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Is now really the time to be saying something like that?!?!"" "
Furudo Erika,""".........So he isn't picking up the phone, and he isn't responding to knocking either? That's troublesome."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...H-He might be in a bad mood again... Kinzo-san sometimes considers even the slightest change to be an omen... and gets into a bad mood for reasons only he can understand..."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hoh, ...hohoho... Yes, that's true... This isn't something that's started today..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Is that how badly Grandfather wants to shut himself away in the study?"" "
Shannon,"""...Yes. ...It's not uncommon for him to stay in his study for more than a month at a time..."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Don't tell anyone, ...but even though I work here, I sometimes forget that the Master even lives here..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Gohda, that's not the sort of thing a servant should be saying!!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""M-My apologies, Madam, ...I am truly sorry..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Anyway, ...isn't it bad that we can't get in contact with him? In the worst case, Father might not even know there's been a crime! Right?!"" "
Kanon,"""...W-Well, I wonder......"" "
,"Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled those words... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,""".........Who was the last person to meet Father...? ...And when?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I-It was me. Last night, ...up until the time of the uproar from when Battler found the gold, I was in Father's study, giving the daily report."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......So at around 23:00 last night."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...No way around it. Let's open it up."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Wh-What did you say...?! This is the Family Head's precious study and research room! No one is permitted to trespass without permission, okay?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Who here holds the highest rank? Me, right?! I am the third in rank of the Ushiromiya family! If we open it and get scolded by Father, that's also the responsibility of the highest ranked. Because of the urgent circumstances, we'll open this door. You have a key, right? Open it."" "
Kanon,"""...I-I believe you know this, but the study door cannot be opened with the master key."" "
Shannon,"""Umm, ...the Master has recently taken away Genji-sama's key as well, so he has both keys on his person. ...Therefore, umm..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......So, both of the keys that can open this door are inside the study."" "
Furudo Erika,"""A closed room. ......<Good>. It's finally starting to get a little interesting. ...It'd be pretty neat if Kinzo-san was lying on the bed in there with his throat cut."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""You're being far too indiscreet, Erika-san!! ...A-Anyway, as you know, this door can only be opened by the keys that Father has."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...That means anyone, even a murderer, would find it impossible to even touch Father from outside the room! So Father must be okay...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Still, that doesn't mean we shouldn't worry about confirming his safety. Are you really so unconcerned for the safety of the Father you respect so much...?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Th-That isn't..."" "
,"The atmosphere, which had been so agitated a second ago, suddenly went cold, ...and an eerie feeling filled the room as everyone stared at Natsuhi. "
,...They could understand why Natsuhi would protect the study under normal circumstances. 
,"People knew that she probably didn't want to disturb the research of Kinzo, a man she certainly respected, and she was therefore trying to keep the unpleasant relatives away. "
,"However, ...this was an extraordinary situation. A murder had occurred. "
,Natsuhi's persistence in keeping things quiet for Kinzo even in a situation like this... was hard to understand using common sense. 
Furudo Erika,"""......There's a good chance that the crime occurring on this island will turn out to be plotline murders mimicking the epitaph. ...It's probably a good idea to assume that the crimes will continue."" "
Furudo Erika,"""If we view these as plotline murders, then it will keep going until a total of 13 lives are taken. ......Do you have any concept of how many victims that would be?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Wait a sec. How many people do you think there are on this island? ...Wouldn't that be almost everyone...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Non non. You've got it all wrong. ......As far as I know, the mystery novel with the most dead people in a serial murder... was ""And Then There Were None"" by Agatha Christie, which had 10 deaths. In the realm of Japanese mysteries, it's probably ""The Tokyo Zodiac Murders"" by Shimada Souji. Though there were less than 10 deaths in that one."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Did you know? If 13 people die, as it seems they will, it'll lead to the most infamous and famous development in the history of the mystery genre, the completion of a 13-person serial murder case, right? And if everyone on this island is killed... "
Furudo Erika,"...that'd make it a historical achievement in the world of serial murder mysteries, with even more deaths than the longest murder mystery in the world and the longest one in Japan put together, don't you see?! ...Hey, didn't you know? Everyone?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""The culprit in this crime... ...is giving us an incredible challenge, one that might even surpass all the mysteries throughout the world and throughout history. ...Of course, everyone realized that long ago, right...? If you like mystery, Christie's a must-read. If you're Japanese, then it's only natural that you've read Shimada Souji's works all the way through. ...Are you sure you've been reading enough, everyone? *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*......"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........It's useless."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Huh......?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Looks like you haven't read enough yourself."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Did I say something wrong...?"" "
,"Erika, who had been chatting away happily all by herself up until a second ago, changed her expression into a displeased glare in an instant... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What you were saying about the Japanese mystery genre. ......Sakaguchi Ango's ""Non-serial Murders"" beats ""The Zodiac Murders""."" "
Furudo Erika,""".........! ............Th- The number of people was the same in both, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""They tie for the record, but ""Non-serial Murders"" was first published in 1947. ""The Zodiac Murders"" was 1981. ...If you know so much about it, shouldn't you have mentioned ""Non-serial Murders"" first?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""......Nng, ............nnngg."" "
,"Erika glared at Battler with an expression that couldn't be fully described with the word ""shock"", and her arms shook as she stood there, lost for words... "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ahahahahahahaha, kyaahhahahahahahahahahaha!! That's so totally laaame!!"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Well, that's understandable. The crimes in ""Zodiac"" took place in 1936, right? That must've gotten her confused, right? Aaahhihihihihihihihhyahahahaahh!!"" "
,"{f:5:Lambdadelta} kept on hitting the table, overcome with laughter. "
,"Even {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had been struck with humiliation, snorted and started pounding the table and laughing in the same way. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Pfft, ......hihihihihhahahahahahaah!! This is just too good!! Giihihihihihihihihihihiii!! ......Not bad, piece Battler. Gahihihihihyahahhaahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaahhh!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""......I'm impressed. ...You must read a lot, ...don't you, Battler-san?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Books? I hardly read those at all."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......You liar. ......You're clearly... ...quite well‐read."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'd never say something as arrogant as ""I'm a book-reader"". ...""I'm a book-reader"" isn't something a person who doesn't even read a hundred per year should say so lightly, don't you think...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Y-You mere...piece......"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Ah, ...*cough*. ...A-Anyway, we can't let such a massive crime take place...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""That's right. At any rate, checking Dad's safety is our first priority right now. But what should we do? He's ignoring the phone and our knocks. The keys are inside. There's nothing we can do. Are we supposed to knock this thick door down? ...That won't be easy."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Father might've been attacked by someone and severely injured, and maybe he's waiting for someone to help him. ...This is an extraordinary circumstance. Even Father will understand. And if he has any rebukes, I'll be happy to take responsibility myself."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......B-But... breaking down a door would be... qu-quite rude..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""What about the window......?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Th-That's right. The window. ...Is there a ladder somewhere that can reach as high as the third floor? We should be able to get inside by smashing the window...!"" "
,"Erika finally came back to her senses, and her tone regained its decisive edge. "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""The third story window... Th-That would be dangerous..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""We won't know unless we try. Is there a ladder around here that can reach up three floors?"" "
Kanon,"""I don't think the ladder in the gardening shed is long enough..."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Oh, then what about the ladder in the boiler room? I remember using it earlier when a bird made a nest on top of the rain gutter...! Yes, that would be able to reach without a doubt."" "
,He must've been extremely happy about thinking of something Kanon hadn't. 
,"Looking pleased with himself as though he had won something, he glanced around at everyone. "
,"He was probably hoping that Natsuhi would praise him, but she quickly avoided his gaze... "
,"Of course, Kanon had known about that ladder too. "
,"...However, in order to protect Kinzo's secret, he had intentionally pretended to have forgotten... "
Shannon,"""But with this weather and the strong winds, isn't this just too dangerous...?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""I agree. If someone gets seriously injured, we can't go to a hospital until tomorrow, right...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...The wind might not be as strong in the courtyard. I think it's at least worth it to take a look."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""But truly, going up to the third floor will be quite a challenge...! Back when we had to clean up the bird's nest, most of the servants shrank away from the danger, and that's when I, your humble servant, took on a major role in spectacularly handling the situation. Hehahahahahahahaha...!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Right, then there's no problem! Let's just get a ladder that'll reach-"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And it looks like someone here already has experience with this sort of thing."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""......Hahahahahaha, ......huh?"" "
,"The courtyard was surrounded on all four sides, so while the rain was still fierce, the winds had almost no effect. "
,"Fortunately, the ceiling jutted out a bit, so even the rain wasn't so bad. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Okay. Let's try standing the ladder up. ...Be careful. Don't hurt yourself."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sure..."" "
,"Rudolf and Battler carried the special ladder, which was designed for work on high places. "
,Two umbrellas followed the pair. Shannon and Kanon were holding umbrellas and sheltering them from the rain. 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It doesn't matter if we get wet. Go back under the eaves. ...Gohda-san! Even if there's something wrong with your knees, you can at least hold a ladder down, right?!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Y-Yes yes yes yes...! If only I had enough Hyaluronan, going up a ladder would be no problem at all... I am truly sorry..."" "
,"Gohda clambered forward to replace Shannon and Kanon. As she watched this, Kyrie giggled. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Dad, hammer."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Cool. ...Battler, you love athletics, don't you?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Not as much as I love my cool handyman Dad{p:0:♪}"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You little brat. ......Sheesh, I guess I've gotta show this son of mine my good side every once in a while. Battler, Gohda-san. Hold that ladder down tight. And make sure you're looking up, okay? My hand might slip and you'll have this hammer tumbling down on you."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't worry. I'll catch it and smash your head in."" "
,"After putting the hammer they'd gotten to smash the window in his pocket and cracking his knuckles, Rudolf started climbing... "
Shannon,"""Will Rudolf-sama...be okay...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""He'll be fine. That guy could totally be in an action movie. Plus, sports are one of his strong points."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...I wish you'd tell me how my skating prowess is supposed to help me climb ladders... ...{p:0:♪}I am Ina Bauer, always in a big pinch...or whatever."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""He'll {c:86EF9C:manage to avoid dying}, so there's nothing to worry about. ...More importantly, we're really lucky the shutters aren't down. Isn't it a common practice to lower the shutters to Father's study for the night?"" "
Shannon,"""Y-Yes. When we're permitted to enter and exit, we open and close them in the morning and at night."" "
Kanon,"""...However, I think it was decided that such a thing was unnecessary for the time being, so it was left open."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I see. .........Father will be pretty mad, won't he? ...If his son smashes his window and comes in while he's sleeping."" "
Kanon,"""...That's...probably..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It'd be wonderful if we didn't have to smash the window, don't you think?"" "
Shannon,"""............"" "
,Both Shannon and Kanon...knew that Kinzo no longer existed in this world. 
,"Natsuhi had ordered them to interfere as much as possible, ...but now that it had come to this, there was nothing the two of them could do. "
,"...They had tried to interfere by pretending they didn't know about a ladder that could reach up to the third floor window, but... "
,"Because of Gohda's showing off, that ladder had been found... "
,Rudolf carefully climbed the ladder. 
,...He would reach the third floor window very soon. 
,"As he did this, ...Shannon and Kanon stared at him, looking uneasy... "
,"After this, ...what will happen next? "
,To the two of them. To Madam. ...To the Master. 
,"...Very soon, Rudolf will reach the window. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...So, it's already the end for this room's barrier."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hahah. The soldiers are scaling the ramparts, trying to reach the other side. The moment of surrender is truly right before our eyes. ......I am prepared to be erased at any moment."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""We can't let that happen. You have to remain alive, even if it means crawling through the dirt. ......I'll think about what to do next. For now, escape from this place."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""You may say that, but what can I do? ...Eva and the rest are still camped out in the hallway, and Rudolf is approaching the window. There's no way of retreat through the door or the window."" "
Ronove,"""In that case, perhaps you could hide under the bed."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Hmph. So I am not even permitted the chance to wait for the enemies' arrival in my throne?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You might've done that while you were still alive, but now you're a ghost that Natsuhi and I brought to life. Ghosts should do what ghosts do best and hide under the bed or in a closet."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Will something like that really deceive their eyes...? My, my."" "
Gaap,"""......Don't worry. I'll be with you. I'll let you escape at the last moment."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""It'll be dangerous for you. Even though you're a demon, you won't get away unscathed if you're burned by the magic-resisting toxin."" "
Gaap,"""Don't worry about that. ......Anyway, I need things to get at least that bad before my heart starts pumping."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""How comforting. ...I understand. I'll hide under the bed."" "
Ronove,"""......Milady, Rudolf will reach the window very soon."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Gaap, I've changed my mind. I'll guard this place. Hide yourself along with Ronove."" "
Ronove,"""What did you say...? You've got it backwards. Didn't we plan to leave this place to Gaap and have you retreat, Milady?"" "
,"Though Ronove should've been used to her fickleness, this surprised him for the first time in a long while. "
,"...Beato may have been a powerful queen, but she was also an important piece that mustn't be exposed to danger. "
,"Though she was strong, running to the front lines without any plan would not be a praiseworthy move. "
Gaap,"""What kind of whim is this...? ............"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It's just a whim. I'm not so fond of boredom that I could simply sip tea while leaving everything to you...! I've just gotten the urge to jump into the struggle right away...!"" "
Gaap,"""............ ...I understand. It is your game, after all. You can do as you wish. I'll carefully watch over the corpses of the first twilight that I erased, making sure nothing happens to them."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Sorry for stealing your time to shine."" "
Ronove,"""......Is this really acceptable, Milady?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You should know I like showing off even more than my three meals a day. I've done nothing but gobble up Gaap's turn. Don't worry about it...!"" "
,...Ronove and Gaap both fell silent. The two of them had already noticed. 
,"Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who used Furudo Erika as a piece, was a terrifying opponent. "
,"...This fight would probably be terrifying as well. Beato couldn't expose Gaap, her friend, to this danger... "
,"Beato bluffed and said that wasn't the case, but Ronove and Gaap had already figured it out. "
,"Therefore, after confirming Beato's resolve one last time and seeing that she was completely firm in her decision, ...they nodded in silence and accepted it. "
Gaap,"""I understand. ...I'll leave this place to you. I'm rooting for you. ......Take care."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yeah. Please watch over my efforts to your heart's content...!"" "
Ronove,"""...Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will probably start trying to expose Kinzo's absence with a closed room argument. ...Fights in a closed room are normally Gaap's area of expertise. ...Queens are commanders because they're best at fighting in wide open areas. ...This won't be an easy fight."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'm fully aware of that. I currently serve Natsuhi. Watching Natsuhi's danger from above and letting Gaap take care of it doesn't make sense to me."" "
Ronove,"""......Understood. ...I wish you luck in battle."" "
Gaap,"""Be careful... ...If it becomes a complete closed room, we won't be able to come in and help you."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'll laugh at them a bit, and if things get bad, I'll just grab Kinzo and run for it. It's easy. With the door and the window, the past and the future to choose from, there are plenty of places to run to. Of course I won't let this become a closed room."" "
Gaap,"""...Though you won't see us, we'll be cheering you on from very close by. ...Good luck."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Sure."" "
,"Gaap and Ronove became a swarm of gold butterflies and disappeared, and Kinzo melted into the darkness beneath the bed. "
,"Then, Beato also became a swarm of gold butterflies and melted away inside the study... "
,"After that, all figures and signs of life had disappeared from the study, and it once more regained a silence as though no one had been there from the beginning... "
,"Then, ...Rudolf's outline slipped into view from beyond the window's curtain. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Dad...!! If you're there, answer! Daaad!"" "
,"As he yelled, he hit the window. "
,His foothold was so uncertain that just hitting the window felt life-threatening. 
,"But of course, this was Rudolf, the show-off. "
,"Deciding that he couldn't do anything stupid with so many people watching from below, he suppressed the fear from being so high up... and boldly knocked on the window. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Come on, Grandfather... Can't he hear...?"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""I-I wonder... I hope he doesn't drop the hammer..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""How many seconds have passed?"" "
Kanon,"""...It's been 30 seconds since he knocked on the window."" "
Shannon,"""So, ...he'll really... ...sm- smash it? Umm, the Master...will be very mad..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Well, someone was kind enough to brag about how accepting that anger is her duty, so there's no need to worry. ...Rudolf-san! That's enough. Do it...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sure...! ......Dammit Dad, you better not complain after I smash it."" "
,"He hit it several times, and eventually, a fist-sized hole opened up in the glass. "
,"Because of his unstable footing, this took a lot of effort... "
,"Using the end of the hammer skillfully, he brushed aside the now fractured bits of glass and opened the hole further, stuck his hand through it, and unlocked the window. "
,"Then, after a hard struggle, Rudolf somehow managed to open the window, and his body slipped through into the study. "
,"After that, he flopped onto the floor, using his entire body to enjoy the relief of having a ground under him. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Dad! It's Rudolf. Answer me!"" "
,It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion. 
,A study. A library. A place to sleep. And a bathroom and washroom. It was divided into multiple rooms. 
,"...That's right, with all this at your fingertips, it wouldn't be hard to spend your days in this study without leaving at all. "
,"The bed was empty. There were marks on it that made it seem as though someone had slipped out, but there was no one in sight. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...This happens a lot in ninja movies. Someone finds that the bed is still warm, so the occupant couldn't have gone far."" "
,"Rudolf tried placing his hand on the bed, but he couldn't feel any heat at all. "
,"Not only was there no heat, ...it felt completely ice cold. "
,And the bed wasn't the only thing that was ice cold. 
,"...The air inside the room...and even the presence about it, if that's the right word for it, ...even that felt ice cold. "
,"To Rudolf, it felt as though Kinzo had slipped out of this room a long time ago... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...However, it's been well cleaned. It has signs of having been lived in. ............"" "
,Wrinkles in the bed. The slight angle of the chair. 
,"Here and there, there were many marks that would doubtlessly have been cleaned or fixed up if someone had come in to make the beds. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""As far as I can tell off the top of my head, Dad must've slipped out of bed several hours ago at the latest..."" "
,That would be the same general time period as the brutal murder case. 
,...Guess we can't be sure Kinzo's absence and the crime are completely unrelated. 
,"For the time being, he leaned out the window... and told Kyrie and the others in the courtyard to come back up, since he was going to unlock the door. "
,"Then, he pushed the button on the study desk and released the door's auto-lock. "
,"There was a heavy clunking sound, and Natsuhi and the rest dashed in immediately... "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...F-Father... Good morning..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sorry, but it isn't Dad. ...I'm the one who opened it."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......Was Kinzo-san there?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Nope. ...It looks like someone slipped out of the bed, but you can't tell when that happened."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to meet him, right...? At around 11:00 last night. I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Th-That's... W-Well, we must consider Father's fickle nature... It wasn't at all uncommon for him to suddenly wake in the middle of the night, claiming to have had a revelation in a dream, and walk around the mansion. Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Nn... T-True, this has happened before... ...Anyway, ...umm, he is a fickle person. R-Right, Kumasawa-san...?"" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""...Hoh, ...hohoho. That's true... Perhaps he had a strange dream and slipped out of bed... That isn't uncommon at all, yes..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Then where did he slip off to...?! Does this mean...there's a good chance Father's been caught up in this crime?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......See? We should have checked to make sure Father was safe from the beginning, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Nn........."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We can't be sure he isn't in this room. Maybe the culprit tied him up and locked him in the closet or something like that."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......Good point. Let's search."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Th-This is the Head's precious study... You mustn't touch things without reason...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ah yeah, that's right, there's something I need to tell you, culprit-san."" "
,"When Natsuhi heard this said right in front of her, her heart froze. "
,...But Erika had only just happened to be standing right in front of Natsuhi when she said it. She had directed her words to the room at large. 
,...She hadn't been speaking to Natsuhi in particular...... 
,"Natsuhi turned her back on Erika, trying to prevent her faltering expression from being noticed... "
Furudo Erika,"""...I have a photographic memory. If you try to alter the crime scene by hiding some evidence, I'll know right away. ...Please don't slip up here and disappoint me. Any mystery where the ""who dunnit"" is solved by a culprit's slip-up or misspeak is only third-rate, don't you think?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......I-I don't understand what you're saying, but try to refrain from incautious remarks. ...Father, are you there...?! Please answer me...!"" "
,"Natsuhi started walking around and calling out in a loud voice, refusing to let Erika say any more. "
,There was a knock. Kyrie and the others who had gone down to the courtyard had returned. 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""So Father isn't here after all?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""He might be tied up and shut away somewhere around here. We were just searching for him."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I'm surprised he managed to shut himself away in a place like this for all that time."" "
Shannon,"""..............."" "
Kanon,"""...Give it up, Nee-san. ...We can't change anything now."" "
Shannon,"""I wonder...what Madam plans to do..."" "
Kanon,"""...Get paid back for all the lies she's told up until now."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""......Shh. ...Let's leave fate in God's hands."" "
Shannon,"""Y-Yes..."" "
Kanon,"""........."" "
,"Many people clambered around Kinzo's vast study, looking here and there. "
,Inside the closet and in the bathtub. Even in the refrigerator and under the study desk. 
,"...They looked everywhere, almost as though they were ""it"" in a game of hide-and-seek. "
,"...However, not only were they unable to spot Kinzo, they couldn't even find a single suspicious mark... "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I-It seems clear that Father isn't here. ...That's enough. Please don't disturb Father's precious study any further."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""That's right, that's right... There's nothing the Master hates more than having things moved around without his permission..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Father's nowhere to be found. ......Maybe he really was caught up in the crime...?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Th-Though we can't be sure of that..."" "
,Natsuhi averted her gaze once more. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...It's okay, Natsuhi."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...We truly do have our backs against the wall... On the off-chance that someone entered the study, I had planned to trick them by saying he'd probably gone for a walk somewhere. ...However..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmph. No one would believe that I'd get dressed up for a casual midnight stroll in a mansion where a murder has occurred and many people have been killed. Though I wouldn't put it past myself to do such a thing."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Come now, Kinzo. Be a good boy and hide under the bed. ...It's okay, Natsuhi. You may remain calm. ......It's possible to prove that someone exists, but you can't prove that someone doesn't exist."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In other words, the Human world is one in which, regardless of whether something exists or not, you can make it so that they ""exist"". ...And the shadows that can make such things ""exist"" are themselves the world of us witches, the world of demons."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...You mean...a Devil's Proof."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. ......So don't worry. The power of demons will most certainly protect you."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......If it could protect the honor of Father and my husband, ...I wouldn't mind sacrificing this body of mine to demons."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Your resolve is good. ...Don't be anxious. I most certainly will not {i:let Kinzo be killed}."" "
,"At that time, a dry sound suddenly rang out twice. "
,"Erika had clapped her hands, seeking everyone's attention. "
,"Though such an action should have been above a guest's place, for some reason, it already felt like a natural right of hers. "
,"...After all, she was the ""detective"". "
Furudo Erika,"""......I think that's enough. Ushiromiya Kinzo-san is nowhere to be found in this study."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Yeah, we've searched everywhere he could've been hiding. Dad's nowhere to be seen."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Furthermore, we've found nothing that looks suspicious."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, we didn't find anything at all."" "
,Erika said it again. They hadn't been able to discover anything... 
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""In that case, we mustn't loiter around this room. Do you understand how angry Father would be if he learned that so many people were looking through his study...?! "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"Eva-san, you said you were prepared to take responsibility, didn't you? Are you prepared for him to break off relations with you for the rest of your life...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Th-That's for Father to decide...!! Not you!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Silence, please. ......I'd like to lay out the situation. At 23:00 last night, the last person to meet Kinzo-san in this room was Natsuhi-san, right? Can anyone confirm that?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Confirm...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, that's right. After all, the only one who claims that Natsuhi-san really did stop by here at 23:00 last night is Natsuhi-san herself. There wouldn't be a problem if Kinzo-san confirmed that Natsuhi-san really did come here last night, but that vital witness isn't here."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......So you're saying alibis are the foundation of a mystery?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, that's right. Alibis are important. Of course, they're almost useless when it comes to the actual theory-making, but it's common courtesy to poke around those boxes."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh. ......You didn't ask for alibis regarding last night's murders, but you'll do it for Grandfather's disappearance, huh? ...You really are a fickle person."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Oh, don't worry. Have no fear that I will fully examine everyone's alibis regarding the murders of the first twilight later."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......So, can anyone confirm that Natsuhi-san visited here at 23:00? If no one can, we'll be forced to doubt whether Natsuhi-san really was the last person to spot him."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...A-Are you saying that I can't be trusted?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""No, no, it's actually the opposite. I hope that you aren't the culprit. After all, that'd make this reeeally boring. Only the worst third-rate mysteries have the most suspicious person as the culprit."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...Natsuhi-san...is suspicious? W-Wait a second. How can you say that...?!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""He's right...! Calling Madam suspicious is the height of discourtesy...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Be quiet!! Doctor Nanjo, Gohda, thank you. ...Erika-san, ...do you have some sort of proof to justify such a rude outburst...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Yes. Though it's so simple that it annoys me. Sorry to bother you with this TV drama-quality evidence, but if you don't mind..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Why don't you just let us hear it?"" "
,"When Battler glared at her, ...a cold expression rose to Erika's face for an instant. "
,"But it was only for an instant. After smiling peacefully and gazing around at everyone, she started to talk. "
,"She looked like the main character in a play, who had come out onto the stage, bathed in a spotlight... "
Furudo Erika,"""It's about this morning. Please remember the time after the murders occurred, during the big uproar that followed. ...We wanted to tell Kinzo-san about the crime, but he wouldn't come out, no matter how many times we called him on the telephone. Remember that time."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Anyway, ...isn't it bad that we can't get in contact with him? In the worst case, Father might not even know there's been a crime! Right?!"" "
Kanon,"""...W-Well, I wonder......"" "
,"Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled those words... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,""".........Who was the last person to meet Father...? ...And when?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I-It was me. Last night, ...up until the time of the uproar from when Battler found the gold, I was in Father's study, giving the daily report."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......So at around 23:00 last night. ............Heheh."" "
,Erika chuckled significantly. 
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""A-And what's your point? Ridiculous."" "
Furudo Erika,"""I think Kyrie-san probably did that intentionally. ...Am I right?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............"" "
Shannon,"""Wh- What do you mean... by that...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I hoped someone might fall for it."" "
Furudo Erika,"""I see. Thanks, Kyrie-san. Actually, I was planning to say the same thing if you didn't."" "
Kanon,"""...I-Is who saw the Master last really that important...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Yes. If we take the circumstances into account, then in response to the question ""Who met him last?"", it was very odd for Natsuhi-san to instantly answer ""me""."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Wh-Why?! Madam told the truth without hiding anything...!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Be quiet!! Why do you think it was odd...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Why are you so sure that no one else met Kinzo-san after 23:00?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...W-Well, ...that's because I watched as he went to bed. It's only natural to assume that he would then sleep until morning and not meet with anyone..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Considering the circumstances, it was easy to suspect the last person to spot him of having some kind of involvement with this case. ...A normal person in Natsuhi-san's position wouldn't say 'I was the last person to meet him. I met him at 23:00'. Right, Kyrie-san...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......... ...Yes, that's correct. ...A normal person would say 'I met him at 23:00. However, I'm not sure I was the last person to meet him'. ...Something like that."" "
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>. ......Claiming to be the last witness is usually quite difficult. ...That is, unless you know something that makes you sure there were no other witnesses after you."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...In third-rate mysteries, the last one to spot the victim is often the culprit. They killed the victim themselves, so they knew that no one else could've met the culprit later on...is how the argument goes."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohoh, ...hohohoho... Couldn't that be nothing more than a minor misspeak...? It's not important enough to be picked up out of the blue and focused on..."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Yes, yes, that's nothing more than nitpicking... Isn't it a little too early to suspect Natsuhi-san because of a little slip of the tongue like that...?"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Furthermore, you said she'd need a reason to be sure no one else spotted the Master, but of course, she had such a reason...! She left the room after seeing the Master go to bed! Following common sense, it's perfectly natural to assume that he probably wouldn't meet anyone else until the next morning...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...No. That isn't natural at all. After all, Natsuhi-san, Doctor Nanjo, and Kumasawa-san all made this claim a short while ago. Please, try to remember."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to meet him, right...? At around 11:00 last night. I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Th-That's... W-Well, we must consider Father's fickle nature... It wasn't at all uncommon for him to suddenly wake in the middle of the night, claiming to have had a revelation in a dream, and walk around the mansion. Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Nn... T-True, this has happened before... ...Anyway, ...umm, he is a fickle person. R-Right, Kumasawa-san...?"" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""...Hoh, ...hohoho. That's true... Perhaps he had a strange dream and slipped out of bed... That isn't uncommon at all, yes..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Yeah. ...We definitely do have testimony... that it wasn't at all uncommon for Grandfather to suddenly slip out of bed late at night..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>. Your memory's not bad, Battler-san. ......In other words, it's common knowledge to those in the Ushiromiya Head House, Natsuhi-san included, that Kinzo-san might wake up in the middle of any given night on a whim and wander around. On top of that, they are aware that this happens quite often."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Isn't that odd? ...If you knew Father often wanders around at night, there's no way you could be certain that he'd stay in his bed until morning. Right?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It really is...like a third-rate mystery. You know, that thing they do in the last 5 minutes, where the culprit asks ""When did you first realize it was me?"" and the detective answers..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Seriously... That's why I feel let down. If it turns out Natsuhi-san really is the culprit, this'll be worse than a TV mystery. ...That's why I want to clear away the suspicion surrounding Natsuhi-san as soon as I can. I want to make sure this mystery isn't third-rate before I do anything else."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Uu, ...nngg..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...There's no need to get anxious, Natsuhi. This is a classic word game used by detective wannabes. ...What exactly is her point? How could she possibly corner you with this accusation alone? In the court of hell, all of the demon jurors will declare you innocent. So calm down and don't get flustered..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......It may be true that Aunt Natsuhi looks suspicious when you say it like that. ...Still, it sounds like you're just nitpicking to me."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But it is suspicious. ...Isn't this more than enough reason to suspect that Natsuhi nee-san's hiding something...?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""O-Of all the unfair accusations...! And how cowardly of you, Eva-san...!! You're the sole person who can confirm that I really was here at 23:00, aren't you...?!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""......Is this true, Eva-san?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......... ......Oh, did that happen? ...Heheheh, I'm sorry. At the time, I was losing my head because of the recently-discovered gold, so I forgot all about bumping into Natsuhi nee-san until just a second ago."" "
Furudo Erika,"""So, Eva-san, you can confirm that Natsuhi-san was a witness at 23:00?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes, unfortunately. I'm able to acknowledge that one part of Natsuhi nee-san's story. ...But only that she came out of this room."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Wh-What are you implying?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Oh, I'll tell you. ...In fact, I've wanted to say this for a long time now. ...I do realize it's improper to bring this up in the middle of such a tragic murder case, but the timing now is just too perfect. ......You know what I'm talking about, don't you? ...Natsuhi nee-san......?"" "
,The servants gulped and held their breaths... It seemed that they hadn't been able to hide it...after all...... 
,"In the middle of this heavy silence, ...Eva fingered her trump card, and Natsuhi tried to act calm. "
,Both space and time grew heavy as lead...and swallowed up everything... 
Furudo Erika,"""Just when did Kinzo-san disappear, I wonder...?"" "
,"Erika's words, spoken almost casually, tore that atmosphere to pieces like shattering glass... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Simply put, we haven't met him once at the family conferences this year or last."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right... We've suspected it since last year. ...Seein' as how my son and the others have just been killed, this may not be the time or place to press you on this. ...But there's a chance that this has somethin' to do with the crime, so pressin' you is just what we'll do..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It's possible that you have a motive for hiding Father's death. ...We have reason to suspect that you're embezzling his assets."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If Father were to die, an investigation would be conducted for the distribution of the assets and your embezzlement would be exposed. That's why you hid the fact that Father's already dead!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""......I see. That's more than enough for the ""why dunnit"". This keeps getting more and more third-rate. Aaah, ...boring."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...I-I don't know what you're talking about...!! You say I'm hiding the Head's death?! I most certainly won't forgive...such a reckless accusation!!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""That's right...!! In addition to Madam, the other servants take care of the Master on a daily basis, and they see him all the time...!! Genji-san, Shannon-san, and Kanon-kun...! Even Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san meet with him often...!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...P-Perhaps because he doesn't trust me, I haven't seen him even once since last year, but..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Be quiet, Gohda!!!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Eek!! M-My apologies...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Aren't all of the witnesses, besides Natsuhi-san, servants employed by her? ...So you used money to make them follow your story...ah man, this is really third-rate. Pitiful, pitiful. ......I'm disappointed, Natsuhi-san. So I guess I'll have to finish this now."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...F-Finish what...?!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ushiromiya...Kinzo-san."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......What is it, ...uninvited guest?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""You don't exist, do you? ...You're a ghost whose death was concealed by those humans who didn't want it known because of the inheritance problem."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Hmph. ...Heheheheheheheh."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ghosts are supposed to quickly pass on to the next world. ...Even though this is the first time we've met, I've yet to give you a proper greeting. My apologies."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Good day, pleased to meet you. And goodbye!!!"" "
,"So close to Erika's face that you could barely have wedged a sheet of paper between them, ...Beato's pipe came to a sudden stop. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And a good day to you too. ...I'm the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden. I'll be your opponent in this fight from here on out."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Glad to meet you. I'm the detective of this game, Furudo Erika. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. And now, goodbye."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, you're Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s next piece after Ange. ...I'm afraid I didn't get to fight with her to my satisfaction in the end. I'm glad I'll be able to lock horns with you this time, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece...!"" "
Furudo Erika,""".........My master is almighty, omnipotent. A fool like you couldn't even begin to compare with her. I accept your challenge."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle* You really are calm. ...Even though a witch has appeared before you and is about to fight with magic and fantasy. ......If you were Battler, you'd be lying on the ground, screaming that this can't possibly be a mystery anymore."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Yeah, even in the mystery genre, parallel universes like this have gotten popular lately. You know about Pure Reasoning Space and all that?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ayatsuji Yukito doesn't make his debut until next year."" "
Furudo Erika,"""You sure are picky for a witch."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hahha!! You think you're on the same level as a witch? Don't be so full of yourself, you mere Human!!"" "
,"When Beato snapped her fingers, something bounced around the room at terrifying speeds...!! "
,It was a Stake of the Witch. A witch's wedge that contained the power of the blue truth within it...! 
,"Of course, a mere Human like Erika couldn't follow that terrible speed with her eyes. "
,"Erika understood this, so she didn't attempt to look every which-way, stupidly trying to spot it. "
Lucifer,"""Eat this, fool!!"" "
,"With a terrible sound, Lucifer's blue stake buried itself into Erika's right collarbone. "
,It pierced all the way through her back. 
,"Lucifer spun and rebounded, landed in front of Beato, and vanished with a shrill laugh. "
,Erika wasn't blown back. ...But she had been run through by the blue wedge. 
Furudo Erika,"""......So, this is that so-called blue truth. Well then, let me hear your views."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:You can't eliminate the possibility that Natsuhi met with Kinzo at 11 p.m. In the six‐plus hours between then and the time you all barged into the study, Kinzo had every opportunity to escape! Because of this, you can't state decisively that Kinzo doesn't exist}."" "
,Beato announced that with an expression worthy of her title as witch. Erika was silent. 
,...Was she too shocked to speak? 
,There was no anguish in her expression. She was just quietly listening to Beato's blue truth. 
,"No, ...judging by her disdainful expression, it's probably more appropriate to say that Beato's words went in one ear and out the other. "
Furudo Erika,"""......<Good>. Let's start with the classic moves. ......By the way, this thing really is stuck good. I can't take it out."" "
,"She tried pulling from the front and the back of the blue wedge that pierced her, but it didn't budge an inch. "
,"However, her indifferent, relaxed expression didn't budge an inch either. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You can't take it out! ...The blue truth can only be defeated by the red truth. ...For one such as yourself, a guest who came to this island at most a day ago, there is no truth that can possibly be known! That means there exists no red that you can use...! In other words, this is checkmate!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...I see. So that's what kind of space this is. ...In that case, I'll need a piece suitable for fighting a witch. ...I'm the detective. My role is to take on the Human culprit. You are a witch. ...And there does exist a fitting piece to use against witches and demons."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Let me introduce you. ......Miss Dlanor, it looks like it's your turn."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......D-Dlanor...!!!"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ahhahahahahahaha!! I thought so, I was certain you'd bring that piece in sooner or later...!! The ten wedges with which to hunt witches, the archbishop of witch hunting, Dlanor!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""There's no more fitting piece in a battle against demons. I have my double, Erika, and the greatest natural enemy of witches, Dlanor. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"I've now taken control of the seventh rank with my two rooks. ...Let me show you, {f:5:Lambdadelta}. And you too, {f:5:Beatrice}. Now you'll see how useless your struggling is. ...*giggle*, ahahahahahaahahaahahahahahahahaha!!"" "
,"The air shone brightly, and the piece Erika had guided there showed its form... "
,That form resembled a clergy member perfectly suited for confronting an evil witch... 
Dlanor,"""It is a pleasure to meet {f:5:you}. Dlanor A. Knox is my {f:5:name}."" "
,"Even though this space was like a bomb just waiting to go off, she introduced herself in a neat and frank manner. "
,"...Her out-of-place appearance, completely different from those of the demons and witches, felt blatantly odd and had a kind of severity to it. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...This is the first time I've met you, but I've heard all the rumors. So, this doesn't truly feel like a first meeting."" "
Dlanor,"""The same goes for {f:5:me}, <Miss> {f:5:Beatrice}. The detailed materials Eiserne Jungfrau has on you are summarized in 600 {f:5:pages}. I always read such reports, so this doesn't feel like a first meeting to me {f:5:either}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The secretary of hell could summarize those 600 pages into 6 letters."" "
Dlanor,"""Allow me to {f:5:ask}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""""Danger""."" "
Dlanor,"""A fitting {f:5:summary}. When I return, I will summarize the materials on you using only 2 letters more, out of {f:5:respect}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""<{p:0:Ｅｘｅｃｕｔｅｄ}>."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......So I'm <{p:0:ｃｕｔｅ}> now, *cackle*! You're too polite, my guest...!"" "
Dlanor,"""Then let us {f:5:continue}. <Miss> {f:5:Beatrice}. I, Dlanor, the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, do humbly accept my role as your {f:5:opponent}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""My first move is over. If you can't remove the blue wedge from that Furudo Erika over there, then you might as well totter back up to heaven and get back to your usual boring job of stamping forms!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Please do something about this wedge thing. It looks like {f:5:Beatrice}-san thinks she's already achieved checkmate with this alone."" "
,"After making a show of tapping her finger on the blue wedge that pierced her, Erika shrugged as though taunting {f:5:Beatrice}. "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...B-{f:5:Beatrice}..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It's okay. I'm just toying with her a bit. .........After all, if things get bad, I can grab Kinzo and run out of here whenever I want. I can leave this room at any time and go anywhere."" "
Dlanor,"""That is {f:5:useless}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Hoh?"" "
Dlanor,"""Now that you've met up with me, this is your {f:5:demise}. Escape will not be {f:5:permitted}. None can {f:5:escape}."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""True, we can't deny that it'd be possible for Father to suddenly wake up and go somewhere. ......But you know what? I can say for sure that such a thing couldn't have happened. Heheheh, you know why?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""H-How could I know...?! Are you trying to say you stood outside this door all night, watching to make sure the Head didn't take a step outside...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes, someone was watching. This kid right here!!"" "
Gertrude,"""Please, allow me to speak. Let it be known that entering or exiting through this door is impossible. The palace guards are ordered to blockade the study door."" "
,"The doors to heaven opened with a strong, unrelenting radiance like the sun's, announcing the arrival of Dlanor's underlings. "
,Those words were clad in the red truth and cut off the witch's method of escape. 
Chiester410,"""Chiester 410, right here!"" "
Chiester45,"""Chiester 45, right here! It has been some time, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}! We were dispatched in accordance with Alliance Agreement #1516 and a request from the Great Court of Heaven. We apologize for the rudeness that is to follow...!"" "
Chiester410,"""We've formed a precision blockade on the study door nyeh. I think it's best if you stay away from it, nyeh? Kihihi!"" "
Gertrude,"""Allow me to speak. I say again, {p:1:From last night at 23:00 until the present time, the study door was not opened even once}."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Wh-What is that scrap of paper?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's a completely ordinary receipt. But even so, this mere scrap of paper proves that you lied."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Last night, when you came out of the study, Eva saw her chance and wedged a receipt into the crack of the study door...! And it fell down just now when Rudolf-kun opened the door for us...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Know what that means? In other words, from 23:00 last night until now, Father couldn't possibly have opened this door!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Wh-What'd you say...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Rudolf, the window was locked, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Yeah. That's why I smashed the glass."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""The other windows are all locked as well. They're built so that you can't lock them from the outside...!"" "
Cornelia,"""Allow me to speak! Know that {p:1:the windows were all locked}! Palace guards, blockade all of the windows."" "
Gertrude,"""By the name of Eiserne Jungfrau, I give the palace guards permission to make use of forbidden weapons."" "
Chiester00,"""Understood. Entire force, Permission Granted for Use of Forbidden Weapon: Red Warhead. Begin Transmitting Activation Code!"" "
Chiester410,"""Unya? The password doesn't work nyeh."" "
Chiester45,"""410, turn caps lock off and try again...!"" "
Chiester00,"""Chiester Squad, Precision Blockade for Study Door and All Windows Complete. We warn the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} that if anything is caught passing through these physically, conceptually, or by any other method, we will shoot without warning...!"" "
Chiester45,"""Data Link from Archangel Satellite 4. Homing Format, Verdict-Model Conceptual Guidance...!"" "
Chiester410,"""And on top of that, we've got Red Warheads nyeh. Impossible to shoot down, impossible to avoid, impossible to survive when hit. ...It'd smash even Lady {f:5:Beatrice} into little bits nyeh{p:0:♪}"" "
,The Chiester Squad had laid down a pinpoint blockade over the door and all the windows. Escape would no longer be permitted through any of these...! 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......My, my. ...I should be doing the welcoming, but it seems I am the one being welcomed. I'm grateful for the courtesy call, and you've even brought the Chiester Sisters...!"" "
Cornelia,"""Allow me to inform you that your paths of retreat have been cut off! Commander Dlanor, let us now remove the sin and purify...!!"" "
Dlanor,"""You've done {f:5:well}. ......<Miss> {f:5:Beatrice}, I've had your paths of retreat {f:5:terminated}. You cannot leave through the door, nor can you leave through the {f:5:windows}. Therefore, escape will now be {f:5:prohibited}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......You think you've shut me in with this alone? *cackle*cackle*..."" "
,The Inquisitor of Heresy in Heaven and her subordinates surrounded the witch. 
,The subordinates used a powerful barrier to cut off Beato's methods of escape. 
,"...Demons tend to resist capture, and as a result, they sometimes escape. "
,"However, angels counter by blocking off passages of escape, allowing them to eradicate their targets without fail...! "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""In other words, this study was a perfect closed room from the time Natsuhi nee-san claims she said goodnight... to the time Rudolf opened the door...!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""In that case, Father would have to be here. But there's not even a trace of him...!! Come on, what the hell's goin' on...?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Uh, ...gah........."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I keep telling you to calm down...! The thought that I, {f:5:Beatrice}, could be shut in just because the doors and windows are closed is simply laughable."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Kinzo, ...I was just playing around, but it seems our guest has no such intentions. Let's withdraw before we lose our chance."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Yes. I would not regret losing this life of mine, but for Natsuhi's sake, I cannot die yet."" "
,Beato waved her pipe and the air was split vertically. 
,"Then, a pitch-black gate appeared there and slowly opened. "
,"...It was a warp portal, the same as the pitch-black holes that Gaap used. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I believe this was written on my files. An elusive phantom. Can appear from anywhere and disappear to anywhere...! As long as Kinzo has me, it will be impossible to capture him...!"" "
,The pitch-black gate opened. That gate led from everywhere and to nowhere. 
,"Both Beato and Kinzo would be sent to a place where no one could catch them, a place where no one could set foot in, much less chase after them...! "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Th-This is the study of the Ushiromiya Family Head. And it is also a room that Father helped to design personally. ...Would it really be so strange if he had some way to get outside without using the door...?"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Y-Yes, that's correct...! There would be nothing strange about the Master having a hidden door...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""A hidden door?! Heh, and where would that be...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""It's a hidden door, so I don't know. ...There are several devices and hidden doors in this mansion that only Father knows of. ...No one has seen them directly, but everyone in this mansion knows about them vaguely. Correct...?"" "
Shannon,"""Uh, ...ah, ...yes...!"" "

Nanjo Terumasa,"""I-It's true that Kinzo-san would probably like devices such as that..."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohoho... And they are hidden doors, after all... No matter how much people such as ourselves might search, {i:it's only natural that we won't find them}. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I see. So it's a Devil's Proof. You're saying we can't deny the possibility that a hidden door exists in this room."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's nonsense, a farce...!! Even considering that your lie about concealing Father's death is about to be revealed, how dare you...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right!! Just where in this study is there a hidden door...?!! Try and prove that it exists!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:No proof is required!! It's a Devil's Proof! The existence of a hidden door is impossible to discover or disprove!! Therefore, no one can eliminate the possibility that Kinzo escaped from this study through a hidden door}!!"" "
Dlanor,"""{p:1:I will not allow a hidden door to exist in this {f:5:room}}."" "
,"Beato's blue wedge, which had been fired off as a farewell gift, was crushed with a flash of Dlanor's longsword, ...and the pitch-black gate was crushed as well...! "
,And it wasn't just crushed visibly and physically. 
,The warp portal conceptualizing hidden doors would remain destroyed from that point onward. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wh-Why can someone like you, who is neither the owner of the study nor the Game Master, ...use the red truth...?! And what was that?! What do you mean you ""will not allow"" hidden doors to exist?!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""It's because this is the mystery genre. {p:1:Knox's 3rd: It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist}. Hidden doors mustn't exist in the mystery genre. Sorry about that."" "
Dlanor,"""In this world, there are no other gods except our god, and no hidden doors {f:5:exist}. They must not {f:5:exist}, and we won't let them {f:5:exist}. They are blasphemy against our {f:5:god}."" "

{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha...!! Here it is, the ten wedges to pierce witches...!! Just like usual, it's the kind of irrational argument I just love to hear...!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""What a fool. The Devil's Proof might've been vague enough to let you escape from everything until now, but now that you're up against Dlanor, that move won't work anymore, {f:5:Beatrice}!"" "
Dlanor,"""...As I thought, you're no different from any witch after {f:5:all}. I'm {f:5:disappointed}."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Beato, ...it seems this isn't an opponent we'll be able to escape from easily after all."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Please do entertain me, {f:5:Beatrice}-san. ...You should at least serve some tea for your guests. It doesn't even matter if it's third-rate!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Come on, please use the blue truth, and tell me how Kinzo-san escaped from the closed room study...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Very well. Make sure you don't cry!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:It's possible that, after slipping out the door, Kinzo noticed the trick with the receipt and correctly returned it to its original place}."" "
Dlanor,"""{p:1:That possibility has already been eliminated in {f:5:red}. After 23:00, the door to the study was not opened even {f:5:once}}."" "

{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Oh, so you can examine every chemical substance in the world? You can rule out the existence of unknown scientific devices?! There's no way you can, it's a Devil's Proof! You cannot rule out their existence}!"" "
Dlanor,"""{p:1:I will {f:5:repeat}. In the name of God, I will not permit such chemicals or devices to {f:5:exist}. From now until the end of time, I will not permit them to {f:5:exist}}."" "

Furudo Erika,"""It's Knox's 4th. It is forbidden for unknown drugs or hard-to-understand scientific devices to be used."" "
Dlanor,"""The progression of humanity, as well as techniques and knowledge that might be obtainable in the future, are decided upon by our {f:5:god}. And the denial of their existence has been proclaimed for {f:5:eternity}. Therefore, I will not allow for such a technique to exist for all {f:5:eternity}. It is not {f:5:permitted}."" "
,Beato and Dlanor had supposedly just gone through a massive exchange of red and blue. 
,"...However, not only did Dlanor not take any damage, she also showed no signs of fatigue. "
,"Beato might have been a fearsome witch, but blood flowed through her veins and she did breathe. She felt both pain and fatigue. "
,But Dlanor...was like a doll made of marble. 
,"She felt no fatigue, no pain, no hesitation. "
,"Even if Beato's sharp wedges had aimed right for Dlanor's eyes, she wouldn't have shut them. "
,"...In fact, it's doubtful that she ever blinks in the first place... "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...B-{f:5:Beatrice}, ...hang in there..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Well, I'd already heard the rumors, but our compatibility really is awful. ...To think that dreams, hopes and even future possibilities would be forbidden. The pride of the gods is overwhelming. ...I'd expect no less from a witch hunt executioner. It seems we'll never be able to enjoy a drink together."" "
,Even the strikes that had made Battler surrender over and over had absolutely no effect on Dlanor. 
,"...Well, I more or less knew that was coming, but to think that I'd be repelled so easily... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Quite a formidable opponent..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh my, so even the great {f:5:Goldsmith} has gotten old and decrepit. Hearing those words come out of your mouth is rarer than seeing two comets in the night sky...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmph. I'm not decrepit, I'm already dead."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hah, that's true. Sorry, but I'm not letting you die for just a bit longer."" "
,Beato experienced something she'd only rarely felt during her entire life. 
,"...It was probably what we'd call ""hardship"". "
,"Beato quietly brushed aside Natsuhi's hand that tried to comfort her, and she regained her posture again, showing off her witch's pride and her continued readiness to fight. "
Dlanor,"""Is that {f:5:all}? There was no need for me to come {f:5:here}. I'm {f:5:disappointed}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'm not done yet. I was just testing a few moves just now. I merely wished to measure your abilities."" "
Gertrude,"""How foolish. Know your place, Golden Witch."" "
Chiester00,"""......Lady {f:5:Beatrice}..."" "
,Beato's expression became tense once again. No longer was there any trace of mischief. 
,...The mood changed. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The time for playing is over. Here I go. In that case, I shall acknowledge that Kinzo did not enter or leave the study. Why don't I accept your closed room?"" "
Dlanor,"""......{f:5:Hmm}."" "
Gertrude,"""Let it be known that {f:5:Beatrice} has changed her pattern of attack."" "
,"{f:5:Beatrice}, who had until then thoroughly resisted the idea that a closed room existed, did an about face. "
,She proclaimed that she accepted their proposition. 
,"Of course, this didn't mean she'd surrendered. This was a new attack of Beato's. Dlanor noticed this and readied herself. "
Chiester410,"""What's going on? Why did Lady {f:5:Beatrice} acknowledge the closed room when she's trying to destroy it nyeh?"" "
Chiester45,"""...Sh-She's probably trying to claim that Kinzo existed outside of this room. ...Confirmation that the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s warp portal has reactivated!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Natsuhi claims to have ""talked with Kinzo in the study"", but she never said that she spoke with him face to face. Therefore, if Kinzo was in a location other than the study, there is no contradiction as long as they held a conversation}!"" "
Dlanor,"""......!"" "
,"After bouncing at an erratic angle, the witch's stake pierced the top of Dlanor's foot. "
Asmodeus,"""You sure are slow. ...Heheheheh, top of the foot, all mine!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Natsuhi used the internal phone line in this study to speak with Kinzo, who was in another place! There's nothing strange about Kinzo, who hates the relatives, predicting that they would enter his study and leaving to go elsewhere. He might have gone to the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian}!"" "
,"Asmodeus's stake, which contained the power of Beato's blue truth and pierced Dlanor's foot, changed into a blue wedge. "
Chiester410,"""Not bad, that makes sense nyeh...!"" "
Chiester00,"""...Blue truth, valid!"" "
,A cyclone of gold butterflies swept up with Beato at its center. ...The magical power of the once-smashed black gate was once again refilled. 
,"...If I can manage to hold Dlanor off here, I'll be able to warp Kinzo out of the study this time, all the way to Kuwadorian...! "
,"Dlanor moved clumsily, trying to pull the blue wedge out of her foot, but it didn't even budge. "
,"Of course, Beato didn't miss this chance. No witch would! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I've got more, so get ready. {p:2:There's a chance that the Kinzo mentioned by Natsuhi does not refer to the person himself! The Kinzo spoken of by Natsuhi might have been another name for this room! Kinzo had taken refuge in Kuwadorian and was impossible to contact. Perhaps Natsuhi called this room ""Father"", and by contemplating inside of it, she felt as though she had received some sort of revelation from Kinzo}!!"" "
Beelzebub,"""We've stopped your movement. You've already lost!"" "
,"Beelzebub's blue wedge pierced the base of Dlanor's neck! Of course, even this didn't cause her to flinch, but her movements were restricted even further. "
Dlanor,"""...{f:5:Interesting}. Is that {f:5:all}?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You don't call it a full course dinner if you stop at the soups and hors d'oeuvres! I'll hit you with the main dish and the dessert at once, so watch your stomach explode as you die!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Even if, as you say, this is a locked room and impossible to escape from, you can't deny the possibility that he is still hiding in this room. I'm not talking about a hidden door! He might be under the bed or above the ceiling! He might be hiding in such a subtle blind spot that even a demon would not recognize it}!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Or, it might be that Natsuhi, ordered by Kinzo to act as his proxy, considered herself both his representative and another Kinzo! In other words, it's possible that Natsuhi was also Kinzo}!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:I've got plenty more!! At eleven o'clock last night, Kinzo escaped out the window! Natsuhi watched him go, then locked the window!! This doesn't lead to any problems. In fact, it might be the most beautiful blue truth yet}!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"How's that?! Dlanor A. Knox?! Hyahhahahahaaaaahhhh!! There are many ways to escape from this closed room!!"" "
Satan,"""Know your foolishness in trying to oppose my master!"" "
Belphegor,"""There's no need for you to argue back."" "
Mammon,"""Just lose and sleep for all eternity...!"" "
,"The Seven Sisters appeared from Beato's golden tornado one after another, piercing Dlanor with blue wedges. "
,"Four blue wedges were buried into her neck, chest, gut, and thigh. "
,"Including the one buried into the top of her foot, she was pincushioned by five stakes. "
Leviathan,"""Aaaah, {f:5:Beatrice}-samaaa, when's my turn?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'll use you if I think of any more. Be quiet for now!! *cackle*cackle* How do you like that, Dlanor the witch hunter?!! After skewering and burning so many witches in the past, how does it feel to be skewered by a witch this time?!! Hehhihhahhaaahhhahahahahahaha!!"" "
,"They were all ridiculous arguments, but they came fiercely one after another. "
,"Though a total of five wedges pierced Dlanor, her expression didn't change in the slightest. "
,"However, her movements had indeed been limited... "
Chiester410,"""Whew... Witches sure are scary nyeh... You can't beat twisted logic nyeh."" "
Chiester45,"""They don't violate the Knox Decalogue... It's valid...!"" "
Dlanor,"""..............."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...W-Well done, {f:5:Beatrice}...! Even if there was no one in this study, and even if it was a closed room, that alone isn't enough to deny Father's existence...!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Against a normal opponent, I'd think the matter settled by now. ...But this is Dlanor, Head Inquisitor of Heresy! This ruthless woman killed even her father when he violated the Decalogue...! Kinzo, now!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Right...!"" "
,"Now that Dlanor had been pinned down, this was their last chance to recover their magical power and escape. "
,"Once again, a pitch-black gate began to rise slowly in front of Beato and Kinzo... "
,"Though the gate had once been opened by simply drawing in the air, it wasn't so easy in the study now, filled as it was with the power of denial. "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Wh-What do you think, everyone?! No matter how much you question the state of this study, you can't question whether or not Father is in good health...!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Oh, so you say. Both you and I... had better not forget that we are part of this battle, right? I cannot fight against witches, but I can fight against you."" "
,Erika grinned at Natsuhi with a smile more demonic than a real demon's. 
Furudo Erika,"""...Natsuhi-san, let me ask again. ...Last night, you're sure you spoke with Ushiromiya Kinzo-san, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Y-Yes. I have said repeatedly that I came to deliver a report for the day and to say good night...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""This may be a strange thing to ask, but since it's needed to prove your innocence, please answer me straightforwardly. ...This Kinzo you speak of is the Ushiromiya Kinzo-san we all know of, right? It isn't a different person or thing with the same name, is it?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I-I'm not really sure what you mean...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...It's like this. You didn't, for instance, start calling this room itself ""Father"" after Father's death, right? That's what she's asking. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"You said you gave a daily report to Father before he went to sleep, right? That doesn't mean you gave a daily report to the wall here all by yourself, inside the study called ""Father"", right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""H-How rude!! Nothing of the sort happened...! Father is Father!! He is in good health! And I most certainly gave him a report and said good night to him last night...!! I'm not trying to trick you or talk my way out of anything!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""I see. In that case, can you repeat what I'm about to say? If you aren't tricking or deceiving us in any way, you should be able to do it."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""F-Fine. I'll repeat whatever you want...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night, speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo while in the same room as him, this room'."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I-I, 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night, speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo while in the same room as him, this room'!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>! Then I'll ask one last thing. ...Seriously now, Natsuhi-san, you didn't do anything like throwing Kinzo-san out the window after your conversation and locking the window behind him, right? Because everything still makes sense if you did."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Wh-Why would I want to chase Father out the window?!! This is intolerable! This mockery is intolerable!!"" "
Gertrude,"""Please, allow me to speak. {p:1:The ""Kinzo"" Natsuhi mentions refers to nothing other than Ushiromiya Kinzo}."" "
Cornelia,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following! {p:1:Natsuhi claims that she was face‐to‐face with Kinzo in the study at 11 p.m.}!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Ah, ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"" "
,"Natsuhi let out a cry, but it was too late... She had been totally suckered in by their provocation...! "
,The blue wedge to the foot representing a telephone discussion... 
,The blue wedge to the neck representing the study itself being called Kinzo... 
,The blue wedge to the gut representing Natsuhi herself being called Kinzo... 
,The blue wedge to the thigh representing Natsuhi letting Kinzo escape out the window and locking it afterwards... 
,The four of them were smashed up with a thin sound...! 
,"Because Natsuhi, ""the one who knew the truth"", had denied them, those denials had gained the power of the red truth...! "
,"Despite Kinzo's absence in this closed room, Beato had introduced five ways that Kinzo could still exist. "
,Natsuhi had carelessly crushed the premises behind four of those herself...!! 
,Only one wedge remained. 
,"In other words, this was the last blue truth that could bury the contradiction of Kinzo existing in the study at 23:00, but not existing there later, after it became a closed room. "
,"There was only the theory that pierced Dlanor's chest, ""Kinzo is hiding somewhere in this room"". "
,"With that theory, even if Kinzo wasn't present in this closed room study, he could still ""exist"" there...! "
,"If this wedge of Satan's were to be crushed, their chances of escaping this room would become hopelessly dim...! "
Satan,"""Gghhh, ......ack...!! B-{f:5:Beatrice}-sama...! Quickly, ...escape while you still can...!! Ggh, gyah..."" "
,"Dlanor slowly grasped the final wedge, which still pierced her chest. "
,"...Apparently, that vice-like grip was hurting Satan as though all the bones in her body were being broken. "
Dlanor,"""All that remains...is this one {f:5:wedge}. It was about Kinzo hiding somewhere in this room, {f:5:correct}?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""As the detective, I've searched all of those places. If I didn't find him, just where could he be hiding? *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"" "
,"With the final wedge still sticking out of her chest, Dlanor slowly approached Beato... "
,"If this wedge was taken out, ...then...! "
Dlanor,"""Allow me to {f:5:ask}. Just where in this study is Kinzo {f:5:hiding}?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Heheh, well then... {p:2:Maybe he's under the bed}?!"" "
Dlanor,"""{p:1:A check of that place has been {f:5:finished}}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Maybe he's in the bathtub}!!"" "
Dlanor,"""{p:1:A check of that place has been {f:5:finished}}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Inside the closet! Under the desk! Behind the curtains}!!"" "
Dlanor,"""{p:1:A check of that place has been {f:5:finished}. Check {f:5:finished}. Check {f:5:finished}}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:Behind the bookshelf, behind the closet, under the carpet, under the floor, above the ceiling, behind the wallpaper, inside the sofa, inside the chair. Inside the bed, inside the blankets, inside the walls, inside a rock, inside a stone, inside the room}!!"" "

,No locations would work against Dlanor by this point. 
,"Dlanor took Beato's final desperate onslaught head on, turning everything back with a far stronger power of denial! "
,Beat them up! Knock them down with overwhelming force!! 
,No longer does any place exist in this study for Kinzo to escape to...!! 
,"Beato was blown back like a leaf dancing in the wind, knocked around over and over again like an empty can lying on a road. "
,"By now, no matter how many times Beato used the blue truth, it wouldn't be able to defeat Dlanor's red... "
Furudo Erika,"""Hahahahaha, ahhahahahahahahaha...!! ......Witches are so pathetic. ...You just try to talk your way out of things endlessly, trying to confuse the truth. Let me borrow Dlanor's words. ...I'm disappointed, {f:5:Beatrice}-san. ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Nggg...............ggghh..."" "
,"Erika coldly delivered these decisive words to Beato, ...who was crawling on the ground. "
Furudo Erika,"""Detective's authority. The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes. I have exercised this right. Therefore, I can say this."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Kinzo-san is not inside this room. Furthermore, this room is a perfect closed room. From the above two points, I can state this fact: this room was empty the whole time. Natsuhi-san lied about having met Kinzo-san here last night! That makes this checkmate, {f:5:Beatrice}-san...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""*giggle*giggle* ...Ahahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha! How's that? Simply by the existence of this room, this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika! What do you think, everyone?! Ahhahahahahhahhahhaaaahh!!"" "
,"At these words, the final wedge shattered, and at the same time, the pitch-black gate that was about to open shattered once again. "
,"This time, the warp portal had been completely destroyed... "
,No longer would Kinzo be permitted to exist in this room...or escape from it... 
,"Beato struggled to her feet, ...but that was the best she could do. She no longer had the energy to fight. "
,She had taken all of the denying red head-on from close range. 
,"It took all her strength just to withstand a pain so strong, it felt like she'd vomit up all her insides... "
,"Even Beato, who had always aimed for the title of strongest and most evil witch, ...couldn't do a thing against a witch hunter. "
,"No matter how sturdy a sandcastle you build on the beach, it can never win against the rising tide... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......S-Sorry, Kinzo... ...Looks like...this opponent really was tough after all..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""{f:5:Beatrice}, I thank you. ...You've done so much for me despite your remaining grudge."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I guess it's true that your life flashes by when you see death coming. ...I've remembered how you once looked when you were young. ......You were annoyingly like Battler."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""I now pass on everything, my soul and the qualifications of the Head, to Battler. I no longer have any regrets...!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Battler......... ...My apologies... ...How pitiful... ...Though I swore to fight with you once again, ...I must settle my accounts like this..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............"" "
,"To Beato, it seemed as though Battler had met her gaze. ...There was no way he could have. "
,"This Battler was the piece Battler. There was no way he could ""see"" Beato in this higher-level world. "
,"However, his eyes really did meet hers. Even though they couldn't have, ......Beato was sure they did. "
,"As Erika, Eva and the others closed in on Natsuhi, questioning her over and over, ...only Battler stood apart from that tumult. "
,His expression held none of the enthusiasm and excitement that the other humans had. 
,It just piercingly and coldly surveyed the scene. 
,And the expression on his face...was a quiet displeasure. Anger. 
,He wasn't feeling compassion for Natsuhi because her lie was about to be exposed. 
,"However, he couldn't excuse Erika, a self-proclaimed intellectual rapist, who simply enjoyed cornering Natsuhi and those who sympathized with her. "
,"Then, he whispered softly. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"{a:c: ""......It's useless.""} "
,Beato and the others definitely heard that... 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You don't think...Battler might...turn things around from this weakened position...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...I probably could have done it, back in the day. ...And Battler can probably do it."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Battler..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Battler, ...if you are indeed the man who will inherit everything from me, ...now is the time to prove it...! Don't let the Legend of the Golden Witch end here...!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""It's true I met Father here last night!! It's true!! And he spoke to me of the Ushiromiya family's glorious history, as well as the burden of bearing it..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Your lie has already been exposed, Natsuhi-san. We already know that you were alone in this room last night."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Isn't it about time to give up and confess? Culprits who are bad at giving up tend to go with bad mystery novels. At least in the end, please prove that this is a slightly better third-rate mystery than that."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Aah, it's useless. It's all useless."" "
,"Battler, who had been silent off by himself up until then, spoke. "
,"At first, it sounded as though he was attacking Natsuhi. "
,"...However, when Erika realized he was glaring directly at her, her expression visibly clouded with displeasure. "
Furudo Erika,"""And just what...are you calling useless?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If this is a third-rate mystery, then the detective's third-rate too. ...Listen up. I'm gonna become Grandfather."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...B-Battler...?!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""You'll become...Kinzo-san? Are you saying you'll become Kinzo-san and reenact his disappearance from this room?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Do you actually intend to deny my checkmate? ...Fool!!!"" "
Dlanor,"""...What is this man {f:5:saying}?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Hey, new girls. ...This here's your first game, right? Sorry, but it's totally useless to call checkmate after a little something like that. Yeah, it's all useless...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Wh-What are you talking about, Battler? You say you'll become Dad...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah. I'll reenact it. I'll become Grandfather and disappear from this room."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Y-You can't use the windows or the door, right?! How would you do it...?!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Did you find a hidden door?!"" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""I don't have a clue either... Yes, not a clue...!!"" "
,*rustle*. 
,......That sound wasn't just the noise of the onlookers fidgeting. ...It was a provocative chill that ran up Erika's spine. 
Furudo Erika,"""......Interesting. I see, you're the Successor to Ushiromiya Family Headship, the one who bears the Head's Ring. That should more than qualify you to stand in for Kinzo-san. ......Why don't you let us have a look at your theory?!!"" "
,Erika's expression was no longer a challenging smile. ...It was malicious. Overwhelmingly displeased. 
,She couldn't conceal her anger at having this very pleasurable time of hers ruined. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......H-How will he...get us out of here...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Heh, ...heheheheh, ...I've got it. I see, so that move is still open."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So you finally figured it out, you damn geezer. Hidden doors and hiding under the bed...all that stuff is so pitiful it brings tears to the eyes. This is {i:the} Ushiromiya Kinzo we're talking about here. ...There's gotta be a more thrilling and exciting answer."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Exactly. How pitiful that even I couldn't think of it, even though it was about me. And how pitiful that the only one of my relatives to understand me is Battler, the kid who's returned after being gone six years. ......Battler, take my place. Do not shame me!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sure, Gramps!! I'll teach these guests what the dignity of the Ushiromiya Family Head is all about!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""What are you planning to do, ...Father...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahahahaha!! Natsuhi, {f:5:Beatrice}, watch! ...We'll show you what being the Ushiromiya Family Head truly entails!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...That Battler, what's he trying to prove...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""There's no way he can do anything. ...This is a perfect closed room!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aunt Natsuhi, come over here. Now, move as I tell you to."" "
,Battler called Natsuhi over to the window and whispered something to her with his back towards the others... 
Furudo Erika,"""...<Miss> Dlanor, you're ready for everything, right? It's not possible for Kinzo and the witch to slip out of this room, right?"" "
Dlanor,"""Of {f:5:course}. ...Gertrude, Cornelia, and the palace {f:5:guards}. Double check that the seal of this closed room is {f:5:perfect}."" "
Gertrude,"""Please, allow me to speak. Our barrier is perfect."" "
Cornelia,"""Allow me to speak. There are no hidden doors, and escape will not be granted through either door or window! Palace guards, when Battler engages the barrier, fire arrows without hesitation!"" "
Chiester00,"""Ch-Chiester Corps, roger. Battler-sama, prepare yourself...!"" "
Chiester45,"""Escaping from this room...is impossible...!"" "
Chiester410,"""......But he'll do it nyeh."" "
Chiester45,"""H-How...?!"" "
Chiester410,"""He's certain he can succeed even without any basis. That's what it means to be the Ushiromiya Head nyeh...!"" "
Ronove,"""......True. Let's watch."" "
Gaap,"""Yeah. ...Let's see the majesty of Riiche's opponent...!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then I'll begin."" "
,Everyone nodded and watched Battler's every move... 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Grandfather was lying in bed like this, grunting his understanding of Aunt Natsuhi's daily report or whatever."" "
,Battler laid down on the bed himself. 
,"As if it still mattered now, Erika grumbled about disturbing the crime scene, but no one listened to her. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then, I stop answering and sleep. ......Well, realistically speaking, I probably get tired of all that talking and only pretend to be asleep."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ahahahaha! You really do get it...!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...I-I see that Father has gone to sleep, ...bow silently, and leave."" "
,"Natsuhi lowered her head to Battler, who was still lying down in the bed, and turned around... "
,"Then, she started wandering around, as though doing an inspection of the room. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...After seeing that Grandfather was asleep, Aunt Natsuhi probably did an inspection of the room before leaving."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Of course, she had Shannon-chan and the others clean it every day, but she still checked it thoroughly herself. ...Making sure there was no dust piling up. Making sure he hadn't run out of any consumables."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Y-Yes. This is the room of the precious Family Head, so I check everything carefully myself instead of relying entirely on the servants. I always do that."" "
Shannon,"""......Th-That's true. Madam usually checks things very carefully."" "
Kanon,"""Her inspections are very detailed, and she even checks all of the consumables in the washroom one by one."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""In other words, we aren't just talking dust on the windowsill, like you see all the time on TV. ......She checks to see that there's enough soap and toilet paper in the washroom. Though she probably doesn't have to do it each day, she's very devoted."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Th-That is my routine. I mustn't slack off in my inspection of the Head's room for even a single day."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......So what's your point? Please keep any showing off to a minimum."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle* Isn't getting to show off the biggest perk to being a detective?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Nng, gah, ...b-but...I'm...the...detective..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Since we're inside the study, you can probably tell, but even though we call it a study, it wouldn't be wrong to call it a second house inside the mansion."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It has a sleeping room, a study, a washroom, and even a toilet and bath. In other words, it isn't a single room. You could call it a full house."" "
Dlanor,"""...Thank you for the explanation of the room's {f:5:layout}. However, the move of having him hide somewhere in this room has already been {f:5:defeated}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""He isn't hiding. However, there's gotta be several blind spots. ...For example, if Aunt Natsuhi went into the bathroom to check the amount of toilet paper, most of the study would be outside her range of vision."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...In other words, for almost every location in the study, the sole observer would have disappeared."" "
Chiester45,"""!! ...O-Observer disappearance...! We've lost track of Kinzo...!"" "
Gertrude,"""Let it be said that the witch's darkness is filling the study."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Excellent. ...Watch as it fills with the power of darkness. Heheheheheheheh!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""So? If the observer...if Natsuhi goes away, so what...? ...What next?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""When Grandfather noticed that fussy Aunt Natsuhi leaving, he got up."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Why?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahhahhahhahha!! On a twisted night such as this, what better way to enjoy a drink than bathed in twisted weather under the night sky!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Since Aunt Natsuhi's in the blind spot of the bathroom, it becomes possible for Grandfather to walk about the study at will."" "
,It was possible for him to move without Natsuhi's knowledge. It was possible for him to move without contradicting what Natsuhi knew! 
Chiester00,"""Warning, Battler is approaching the study door."" "
Gertrude,"""Allow me to speak. A noise rings out when the lock on the study door is released. Know that {p:1:you cannot leave through the door without drawing Natsuhi's suspicion}."" "
,"Because Battler had acted as though he was heading for the door, Gertrude, who was sealing the door, immediately sent out a warning. "
,Maybe it was possible for him to leave the study while in Natsuhi's blind spot. 
,...However. 
Furudo Erika,"""That's right, ...there's the sound!! We know there's a loud sound when the auto-lock is released! Even if Natsuhi was in a blind spot inside the study, she wouldn't miss hearing that. Of course she'd find it odd...!!"" "
Gertrude,"""Allow me to speak. Let it be said that {p:1:Natsuhi did not hear the sound of the door opening while in the room}."" "
,"The washroom and toilet are very close to the door. Even if they hadn't been, that auto-lock always lets off such a massive sound. "
,She'd be able to hear that sound no matter what. 
,"Natsuhi had already spoken with Erika and the others about the details of the previous night, making it quite clear that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. "
,Any argument that relied on Natsuhi failing to hear the lock wouldn't work...! 
Gertrude,"""Please, allow me to speak once more. {p:1:Kinzo entering or exiting through the door will not be permitted}."" "
Cornelia,"""Let it be said that this is a useless struggle! It is foolish...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......It's true I can't break through the red of that girl by the door. ...But what about you over there by the window?"" "
Cornelia,"""......!"" "
,"Turning his back to Gertrude, who claimed that leaving through the door was impossible, Battler locked his gaze on Cornelia, who stood in front of the window. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Make sure you hold that barrier of yours up tight. ...'Cause you're gonna be......{i:blasted away}, okay?"" "
,"By now, Battler's target was clear. ......It was Cornelia. It was...the window. "
,He was going...to smash this closed room from the window. 
,"Not expecting to be chosen as the target herself, Cornelia was overawed for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure. "
,"On rare occasions, struggling, fleeing witches would directly challenge the barriers Cornelia set up. "
,"Such witches were always fighting desperately, on the brink of death! "
Gertrude,"""Please, allow me to speak. You are Battler's target, Cornelia. I ask that you be on your guard."" "
Cornelia,"""Fool! God, have pity on this foolish lamb...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'm no sheep. ...The Head of the Ushiromiya family is an eagle. With one wing. ...Don't think you can keep me shut up in this study forever with just a flimsy window like that."" "
,"...Starting from a low posture, ...both silent and supple, ...Battler ran forward like a white leopard. "
Furudo Erika,""".........Th- This guy... ...couldn't possibly mean to......!!"" "
Cornelia,""".........!! Th-This is.........agh. A-Allow me to speak...! There is no way to defeat my red! Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"" "
,"Cornelia thrust out both her arms and made a sign. When she did, a red barrier closed in front of Battler. "
Cornelia,"""Know that your course is a fruitless one, Ushiromiya Battler...! Know that {p:1:these windows are sealed from the inside, and Natsuhi did not help Kinzo to escape}!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:I'm not saying Aunt Natsuhi helped Grandfather escape. ......What if Grandfather snuck out, keeping it a secret from Aunt Natsuhi}?!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Wh-Why would Kinzo go out the window on his own?!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""What better way to enjoy a drink on a twisted night... than leaping through the rainswept skies!!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""But this is the third floor, right?! It's impossible!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Even you've jumped down a flight of stairs at least once in your life, right? Three stories is nothing for Kinzo...!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""I wouldn't put it past him."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""I certainly wouldn't."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Th-That's...r-ridiculous...!!!"" "
,"Blue cracks appeared in Cornelia's red barrier, and it shattered with a crisp sound. "
,It was all far too quick. 
,It looked almost as though she'd gotten out of the way herself in fear of Battler. 
Chiester45,"""E‐...{ruby:99.9999999...:endless nine}...!! Magic resistance, {ruby:99.9999999...:endless nine}!!"" "
Chiester00,"""Cornelia-sama, you can't block it, retreat...!"" "
,"At the same time the barrier shattered, the window behind Cornelia's back was flung open. "
,The curtains fluttered for just an instant. 
,"Though it was all filled with rain, the heavens and the courtyard were spread out in front of them... A fitting exit for an eagle leaping from this closed room! "
Dlanor,"""Cornelia, repair the {f:5:barrier}!!"" "
Cornelia,"""As you wish, Commander Dlanor! Kn-Know that you will not be allowed to break this...!!"" "
,Cornelia quickly returned to her senses and set up another red barrier. 
,"...However, this was her last one. "
Cornelia,"""Please, allow me to speak...!! Let us accept for the time being that Kinzo escaped through the window...! In that case, how did he lock a window which cannot be locked from the outside?! {p:1:The window was locked from the inside}!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Useless!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, it's all useless!!"" "
,Kinzo and Battler grinned! 
,"Did she think this feeble red could block the charge of Battler and Kinzo, the two Family Heads? "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:After Grandfather jumped out the window, Aunt Natsuhi probably noticed a slight draft. She then approached the window, realized that it was wide open, and quickly closed and locked it}...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""{p:2:Natsuhi probably couldn't even imagine that I had slipped out the window}!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:Yeah!! So it's only natural that Aunt Natsuhi thought Grandfather was sleeping in bed}!!"" "
,"Now that Battler had found the answer, the red barrier was more fragile than thin glass. "
,"The red magical wall of certainty had been smashed again, so easily that it disgraced the name of certainty itself! "
,"Unbelievable, right? "
,That barrier was more firm than any Ronove had ever used against Jessica. 
,And yet it had been...destroyed so easily...! 
,"Though Battler was rushing fiercely and had almost reached Cornelia, she didn't step aside. "
,"Her steel spirit, worthy of the name Eiserne Jungfrau, didn't allow her to step aside. "
,"She took a charm from her pocket, placed it against the thin air, and made a sign. "
,"Then, not red, but blue burned there. Though it was far more frail than the red barrier, it was her last method of resistance. "
Cornelia,"""Y-You won't get through, you won't!! Let me speak, let me speak!! {p:2:Be that as it may, this is the third floor...! How could a wingless human escape from the window}......?!! Know that you won't get through, you wooooooooon't!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Just quit your whining and watch!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:This is the answe{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er{-}r{-}r{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}ra{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh}!!"" "
,Battler...jumped. 
,"He burst through Cornelia and her blue barrier, knocked them away, ...and his body flew out the window through the darkness of the rainy sky. "
,"The fragments of the blue barrier scattered, beautifully adorning the surrounding air. "
,The closed room... ...had been smashed open...!! 
,Battler...flew out of the mansion. 
,Through the sky above the rainy courtyard. 
,...All the raindrops became small round gems and were scattered through the air. 
,"Battler flew across the treasure box world of that exquisite stormy sky, ...through the countless gems of rain that filled it. "
,"In the sky over the world frozen in time, Dlanor and Battler faced each other. "
,"If Battler, who had smashed and flown out the window, was like a knight leaping off a white horse, ...then Dlanor was another knight, who floated in the air, waiting for him. "
,"In the air above the courtyard, surrounded by the Ushiromiya mansion and frozen in time, ...the true new Head of the Ushiromiya family and the disciple of heaven who would test him crossed paths... "
Dlanor,"""...Well {f:5:done}. When you fall into the courtyard, whether you live or die, it won't change the fact that Kinzo could have defeated this closed {f:5:room}...!! You who have thrown away your life and jumped are a {f:5:martyr}...!! Well done, you have smashed our closed room {f:5:barrier}. Splendid, Ushiromiya Battler!!"" "
Dlanor,"""However, I am the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, Dlanor A. Knox!! I cannot allow you to escape out from under my {f:5:nose}...! Now, at the end, allow me the honor of crossing swords with {f:5:you}!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sure, bring it on. ...This game is surprisingly unrelenting."" "
,In this world where the gems of rain...fell slowly like large snowflakes on a snowy field... 
,...Dlanor and Battler slowly......crossed paths. 
,"It seemed slow. And yet, ...it happened in a flash. "
,Their gazes crossed and clashed like lightning. 
,"Knight confronted knight head on, and everything would be settled with a single strike...! "
,Blue and red...crossed paths... 
Dlanor,"""{p:2:Was the existence of Natsuhi's blind spot within the study depicted {f:5:beforehand}? If it was not, this theory is {f:5:impermissible}}. {p:1:Knox's 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}}...!!"" "
,Dlanor's double strike with both the blue and red blades reached out to slice Battler. .....and failed. 
,"Those longswords, which had never lost over the course of a hundred battles, cut through empty air... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:1:When we entered the study, its structure was mentioned clearly}. ...Too bad for you."" "
,"For the first time, an expression showed on Dlanor's face. ...It was a sudden smile. "
,She had known about that long before. 
,"...However, she still couldn't let him escape without attempting that single strike. Not even with her reputation as an Inquisitor of Heresy on the line. "
,"She still crossed swords with Battler, even though she knew it would fail. "
Dlanor,"""Yes, I {f:5:knew}. ...With your answer, Knox's 8th is not {f:5:violated}."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Here it comes. No hard feelings."" "
Dlanor,"""Yes, {f:5:come}."" "
,In Battler's hand...was a blade that shone red. That blade etched out the red truth... 
,{p:1:― It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.} 
,{p:1:― A study. A book archive. A place to sleep. And a bathroom and washroom. It was divided into multiple rooms.} 
,That has already been shown. 
,And it suggests that there could have been a blind spot somewhere within the room... 
,"Without any mercy...no, without any reluctance, which would have been dishonorable, ...the sword of red truth cut into Dlanor. "
,It cut a beautiful hemisphere through the countless gems of rain that filled the sky... 
Dlanor,"""Well......{f:5:done}..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........."" "
,Time...exploded into life. 
,Both of them...fell through the courtyard. 
,One drifted down. The other tumbled through the air. 
,"Then, there was a soft sound and a dull thud. "
,...The first was the sound of Battler landing gently in the courtyard. The second was the sound of Dlanor crashing down. 
,"After crouching down for a while, ......Battler slowly stood up. "
,"Though he had jumped down from the third floor, ...he had landed as lightly as though he had merely jumped over a fence... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""B-Battleeeeeeeeeeer......!!"" "
,"Beato leaned out of the study window, looking to see if the supposedly wingless Battler had landed safely. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Beato!! Come on, jump!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Huh...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That window is our way out! ...So jump!! You aren't the kind of witch who can be locked up inside a closed room, right?!!"" "
,"The study was no longer a closed room. She could jump from here, escape from here...! "
,"By now, the closed room that had threatened to capture the witch and suffocate her...had been destroyed. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Y-Yes...!! Y-You too, Kinzo...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Go. From the moment Battler showed his answer, my spirit had already escaped from this room."" "
,"Kinzo's form became a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared. The closed room barrier had dissolved, and the power that denies magic had scattered. "
,Beato ran towards the window. ...That was the only exit from the closed room of this witch hunt. 
,"After glancing at the Chiester Sisters and the subordinates of the Inquisitor of Heresy, she readied her wound-covered body and ran towards the window, just like Battler had done. "
,She looked like Cinderella running as she heard the bell toll. 
Furudo Erika,"""Th-There's no way we'll let you escape, {f:5:Beatrice}, Illusion of the Witch!!"" "
,"Erika flew at Beato, trying to latch on to Beato as she dashed, but it was like trying to catch smoke, and she landed face first on the floor. "
,"...There's no way a Human could catch a witch. For one such as her, without love, even touching Beato was impossible...! "
Furudo Erika,"""Chiester Corps, shoot the witch! Shoot her dead!!"" "
Chiester00,"""Alignment conflict. Unable to fire."" "
Gertrude,"""Allow me to speak. I have no barrier prepared that can block Battler's blue truth."" "
,Both Chiester 00 and Gertrude spoke with unbelievably calm voices. 
Furudo Erika,"""N-No one can stop them? Not Battler? Not Kinzo? Not {f:5:Beatrice}?! If these guys manage to escape, ...m- my closed room, my theory...!! "
Furudo Erika,"I'm... ...the detective, ...Furudo...Erika... kkggghhhaaaaaaaaaaaggghhgh! Gyaaaaaaaaaaggghhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!"" "
,"Erika crouched, screaming and clutching at her head. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The great Golden Witch isn't gonna be defeated by something like that geezer's grubby study!! It's still just the first twilight! I'll teach these newcomers that your game isn't that easy!!"" "
,"Just like Battler, Beato also...flew. "
,She drifted down through the rain treasure box world into Battler's chest. 
,...Battler caught her with both arms as though catching a feather from an angel. 
,"It was like a knight catching a princess who had been locked up in a tower, ......like a beautiful picture of a scene in some fairy tale... "
Gaap,""".........Crap, I think I'm in love. ...Are all the Ushiromiya Family Heads like this?"" "
Ronove,"""If you were to write down the unprecedented feats of Ushiromiya Kinzo, ......you would probably have an uproarious tale longer than all the grimoires in the study put together. It seems the tale of the next Head will be worth writing down as well. In fact, it already is being written. It's already a very, very long tale. ......Pu ku ku ku."" "
,"The demons giggled on top of the roof, holding umbrellas. Then, they quietly looked down over the two in the courtyard. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""H-Hahhahhahahahahahaha... ...You're...not bad at all..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I guess all your games've toughened me up."" "
,"In shock, Beato...actually praised Battler as he held her in his arms. "
,Battler laughed in his usual carefree way... 
Furudo Erika,"""......Th- This is...... impossible, ...impossible!!"" "
,"Erika looked down from the window and clenched her teeth, still clutching at her head. "
,"Still holding Beato in his arms, Battler grinned back. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Erika."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Wh-What...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'm not giving the riddle of the Golden Witch to you. I'll solve it. ...That riddle belongs to the two of us. Right, Beato?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I-Indeed...! My riddle is...yo......yo......"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yo?"" "
,"When Battler laughed evilly, Beato's face turned uncharacteristically red, but even so, she spoke while laughing loudly. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""My riddle is... yo...yours... ...yours alone...!! Ushiromiya Battler! I won't let anyone else solve it...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heheh, listen to her, saying something like that...!!"" "
,"Battler snorted, amused that Beato had said something so out of character. "
,"And, still holding Beato in his arms, he spun around in a kind of waltz. "
,The falling gems of rain celebrated their victory over this trial... 
Furudo Erika,"""......He jumped down from the third story...? ...And he's all right...? He jumped down...and escaped from the closed room...? Th-This is ridiculous... This isn't reasoning...... It's insane!!"" "
,"If Battler had at least been seriously injured and writhing in the mud, ...Erika might still have had some ground to stand on. "
,She might've been able to claim that Kinzo couldn't have jumped down with his old body and gotten away unscathed. 
,"...However, Battler stood calmly in the courtyard, looking up at Erika with the dignity of the victor. "
Furudo Erika,"""Everyone, I...I'll ask one more time. ...This is...impossible, right? There's no way a Human could jump down from a third story and land unharmed...!! "
Furudo Erika,"Isn't that right, everyone...?! Much less Kinzo-san jumping down from the third floor at his age!! This isn't reasoning!!"" "
,"Erika tried to get everyone's agreement and somehow turn things around, ...but their responses were no different from how they'd been a short while ago. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""No, it would be possible for Kinzo-san."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I wouldn't put it past Father."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This is Father we're talking about..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""There's plenty of crazy stories about that man. Somethin' like this wouldn't surprise me a bit."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Wh-What......?!! I-Is there something wrong with your heads, with your brains, people?!?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""At any rate, ...it looks like your closed room argument wasn't perfect."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ah, ...gggrrrrrrrrggh...!!"" "
,"Not only the servants, but the family members also agreed. "
,They all agreed that there was nothing strange about Kinzo jumping down from a third floor window. 
,J-Just who in the world...is this Ushiromiya Kinzo person...?!! 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Well, I'll give you 60 points... Kinzo would've done it with a bit more flash in his younger days. It needs some more tweaking."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh, and how much should it be tweaked?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""W-Well... Umm, ...h-he might have jumped down with me in h-his arms!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Got it. Next time, I'll do that."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...I-If you think you can, just you try..."" "
,"Beato's voice grew very faint, and she gulped. "
,"Then, her body suddenly crumbled away into a cloud of gold butterflies. "
,"That was because many people had rushed up to the window, and she was being bathed with gazes filled with the anti-magic toxin. "
,Beato's body became invisible to them and melted into the air... 
,"So to their eyes, it appeared that Battler was standing all alone out in the courtyard... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Battleeeeeeeeer!! You okaaaaaaaaay?!!"" "
Shannon,"""I-It looks like he's fine...! Thank goodness!"" "
Dlanor,"""...I have {f:5:lost}... ...In that case, for the benefit of those people in the study as well, ...deliver your final blow to {f:5:me}. Use your final blue truth to show how Kinzo escaped from the closed room of that {f:5:study}."" "
,There was no pain in Dlanor's expression. ...Pleasure and pain never showed up on her face in the first place. 
,"However, she was only barely able to rise to her feet, using her longsword as a crutch, so it was easy to guess at how heavily she'd been damaged. "
,"And, despite her lack of an expression, you could tell that this was a loss she could accept. "
,Battler and Dlanor turned to face each other. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Here I go."" "
Dlanor,"""Yes, {f:5:come}. ........."" "
,"As though readying herself, Dlanor quietly closed her eyes, but she still stood tall and maintained her air of dignity. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""This is my blue truth."" "
,The blue power gathered. ...Battler slowly approached Dlanor. 
,"Then, he faced the rainy sky and yelled out the blue truth. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo escaped from the study through the window when Aunt Natsuhi couldn't see him. Aunt Natsuhi didn't notice and locked the window. This way, Aunt Natsuhi can see Grandfather go to bed at eleven o'clock and Grandfather can escape from the study without contradicting the lock of the window or the door sealed by the receipt. I proved through my demonstration that this escape was physically possible. Therefore, this battle is over}!!"" "
,"The blue wedge flashed through the courtyard along with a blue bolt of lightning, roaring down towards Dlanor's forehead as she stared up at the sky. "
Dlanor,""".........!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Beato's game isn't forgiving. It's doubtful whether the classic patterns of the mystery genre even work here. Your swordsmanship isn't bad, but you ought to be a bit more flexible in your thinking."" "
,...A massive blue wedge that looked like a pillar...was above Dlanor's forehead... ...and had stopped with its tip just slightly touching her. 
,It didn't run her through. 
,...It made no mark larger than being poked with a pencil. 
,"When Battler snapped his fingers, the blue wedge shattered and became a shower of translucent gems... ...no, drops of rain that poured down over the courtyard. Dlanor sat down in a dazed sort of way... "
,"Amidst the thunder and rain, "
,the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship faced the people staring down from the study... and spread his arms wide... 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Welcome to Beato's and my game. Welcome, Furudo Erika...!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ahhaha, ...... ......Ahhahhahha, kahhahhahhahha...!! How amusing, Ushiromiya Battler...! <Good>, truly <good>...!! Ahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!

,"Battler and Beato both looked calmly up at Erika, who couldn't contain her evil laugh... "
