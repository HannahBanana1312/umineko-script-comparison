Speaker,Steam (ST)
,"The marriage ceremony ended without any problems, and the reception was held inside the cathedral... "
,"As the goat demons partied raucously, Dlanor could be seen leaning against a pillar, trying to escape from the noise. "
,"Then, Gertrude appeared and whispered some kind of report to her. "
Dlanor,"""......Is that {f:5:true}?"" "
Gertrude,"""Allow me to speak. Aide Cornelia is currently heading towards the scene. ...I suggest that Lady {f:5:Erika} be contacted as well."" "
Dlanor,"""{f:5:Understood}. I will tell {f:5:her}. ...Gertrude, contact the head of ceremony {f:5:security}. ...Prepare for {f:5:battle}."" "
Gertrude,"""As you wish."" "
Chiester00,"""I apologize for interrupting your chat. I am in charge of security for this ceremony."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Huh? Is it me?! Do you want something?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...I told you you were going too far. Champagne Tower Bowling was always a bad idea. Looks like it's time for a scolding. *giggle*giggle*..."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hey, Beeeeeeern!! Hey, what's going on, did I do something wrong?!"" "
Chiester00,"""The reception desk has received an envelope from an unknown sender addressed to Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""I always ignore anonymous calls and letters. Just throw it away."" "
Chiester00,"""But, ...please look at this..."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""......What's that? ...Did you tell anyone you received this...?"" "
Chiester00,"""No, only the two Sisters at the reception desk and I know. They have already been ordered to keep silent."" "
,"The instant she saw that envelope, {f:5:Lambdadelta} snatched it away and lowered her voice. "
,...{f:5:Bernkastel} had walked away and was apparently making fun of Erika. 
,"Bern—and of course, Erika—were both drunk. If they were left alone, they'd probably forget about this. "
,It's true that this envelope has no sender written on it. 
,"...However, the seal done on it in gold leaf... fulfills the same purpose. "
,...This seal is... 
,"{f:5:Lambdadelta} hid behind a pillar, ripped the envelope open, took out its contents, and read them. "
,"Her eyes instantly started to glint, ......and she smiled like a kid who's just thought of a nasty trick... "
Chiester00,"""...What is to be done? The sniper team is carrying red warheads. If you give your permission, I will give the order to load them."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...... ...What are you talking about? Do you realize how important these guests are? If a stray bullet hits one of these attendants, all the new Chiester Sisters will be sent straight from the factory to the guillotine for the next ten years."" "
Chiester00,"""Understood. We will intercept with regular warheads. Shall we post watches around the Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Why would we need those? After all, the Seven Stakes are Battler's...and now Erika's furniture. Why would we post watches around our allies? Just make sure security is nice and tight."" "
Chiester00,"""Just now, we received a recommendation from Assistant Inquisitor Gertrude suggesting that we make preparations for battle. Her reasons are unknown."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""From Gertrude? ......Heheh. Then follow that recommendation. A party's more fun once you liven things up...!"" "
Chiester00,"""Understood. ......00 calling Chiester 17, Chiester 38, Chiester 45, Code R, be on your guards. Transmitting level 2 alert."" "
,"""17, <copy>."" "
,"""38, <copy>."" "
Chiester45,"""45, understood...!"" "
Chiester410,"""It'd have been so much cooler if you'd said <copy> too nyeh."" "
Chiester45,"""Ah, I just got nervous...!"" "
Chiester410,"""Ah, right. 45, come over here a second."" "
Chiester45,"""Wh-What is it? H-Hey, we're on the job...! Stop, don't play with my ears...!"" "
Chiester410,"""Your ears. Better fold them down nyeh."" "
Furudo Erika,"""......What did you say...?! You're kidding, right? That's impossible...!"" "
Dlanor,"""Cornelia is heading there {f:5:now}. ...The odds of {f:5:Beatrice} attacking here are extremely {f:5:high}. I recommend suspending the reception and {f:5:evacuating}."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""What's going on, Erika...? Something go wrong with the entertainment...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""N-No, my master...! Please continue to enjoy the reception. ...Hey, somebody, let's get Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} some more dried plum wine...!"" "
,Erika didn't have time to hide her agitation. 
,"When {f:5:Bernkastel} saw this, ...she knew that their final, late guest had finally arrived. "
Asmodeus,"""Luci-nee, I hear there's been some movement in the guesthouse."" "
Lucifer,"""...The guesthouse? Who cares about the game board now?"" "
Beelzebub,"""Well, ...they're saying that Kanon-kun disappeared from the cousin room..."" "
Satan,"""What?! Are you a moron? The cousin room is a perfect closed room, with the door and all the windows perfectly sealed. It's impossible for him to escape...!"" "
Belphegor,"""No, I've been snooping about as well. ...There's no mistake. Kanon has disappeared from the cousin room."" "
Mammon,"""...He's probably hiding somewhere in the cousin room. Or else, he's managed to trick everyone since the beginning...and was never in that room to begin with."" "
Leviathan,"""That's impossible. It's been guaranteed that ""everyone"" is in the cousin room except the specific names Lady {f:5:Erika} read aloud back then. It's impossible for him to trick his way out of there."" "
Lucifer,"""...How did he get past the Jungfrau seal barrier...? No, first off, where on earth is Kanon? Find him at once...!"" "
,"At that moment, the cathedral suddenly went black. "
,The surprised commotion of the guests filled the cathedral... 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""......She's here."" "
Chiester00,"""00 calling <All Chiesters>. Code R Alert! Chiester 17, can you repair the electrical systems?"" "
,"""Negative. Communications with the management staff have been severed."" "
Chiester00,"""<All Chiesters, Code Red>! <Rock ""n"" Roll>!!"" "
Chiester410,"""<Copy.>"" "
,"""<Copy.>"" "
,"""<Copy.>"" "
Chiester45,"""U-Understood. Ah! I mean <copy>!"" "
,The sniper teams in the chandeliers all released their safeties at once. The entire security team down in the hall loaded their ammunition. 
Dlanor,"""...Lady {f:5:Erika}, let us evacuate to the waiting {f:5:room}. It is dangerous {f:5:here}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""What's dangerous?! I'm the territory lord of this world! Why should I have to run away in fear?!"" "
Dlanor,"""Gertrude, set up a VIP guard {f:5:barrier}. Call Cornelia back here at {f:5:once}."" "
Gertrude,"""Yes, executing."" "
Furudo Erika,"""A barrier?! I need to be wrapped in one of your pitiful, pathetic barriers while I'm wearing a wedding dress?! How insulting!!"" "
,"This disturbance made even Battler groan, as he sat in the next seat over like a doll... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Uuu......"" "
,"Even with his soul sealed, Battler probably realized that something strange was going on... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""She's late. Right, Lambda?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Totally. She sure kept us waiting."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""What was that just now? A love letter from someone...?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""A fan letter. From the Lambda-chan Fan Club."" "
,{f:5:Lambdadelta} played dumb and munched some popcorn. 
,"Then, the lights finally turned on... "
,"It was clear that during that blackout, ...{f:5:Beatrice} had snuck in somewhere nearby, possibly even inside the cathedral itself. "
,The whispering demon attendants all realized it as well. 
,"Whose scheme was this, ...and what were they doing? "
,"...Though it may have been imprudent, they were looking forward to this, and an excited chatter filled the cathedral... "
Gaap,"""Looks like she came."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""G-Gaap...! They let you come back too...?!"" "
Gaap,"""Come on, putting me in a jail is pointless."" "
Ronove,"""True! Pu ku ku ku."" "
Gaap,"""...But Riiche. ......Battler's closed room, the cousin room, ...and even the final possibility, the next room over, have all been sealed... ...How are you planning to save Battler...?!"" "
Ronove,"""Let us suppose... that Milady has found some trick X. If so, she would inevitably have to march in here to thrust that in Lady {f:5:Erika}'s face..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""But...against all of these Chiester troops...? ...I can't believe this many of them were hiding here...! It's impossible... She'll be sewn to death...!"" "
,Rabbit ears dashed all about the hall. 
,...Incredible that she could remain hidden and unnoticed with so many people around... 
Gaap,"""...If she can just get close enough to challenge Erika, ...she should be able to get herself an even fight."" "
Ronove,"""I see, that move. ......However, does Milady have that item with her? ...She always complains, and dislikes it when I prepare them for her. ...My, my. She's a troublesome one to the end."" "
,"Amid the crowd, Ronove took something out and showed it. "
,"...When {f:5:Virgilia} saw, she understood what ""that"" in his hand meant... "
,"True, with ""that"", ...it should be possible to stop the attacks from the Chiester troops... "
Gaap,"""Well, if it doesn't work on Erika, we're through. The problem is getting her right in front of Erika, if only for a second. ...The Chiesters will probably prevent that with all they have. ...Lia, ...do you think you can gain her that time...?"" "
,{f:5:Virgilia} gave a small nod. 
,"However, the problem was the two Chiester troops standing at her back. "
,"...Since the time she'd tried to jump out in front of the procession, she had been marked constantly... "
,"It was possible, with {f:5:Virgilia}'s vast magical power, to momentarily take out all of the Chiester troops in the cathedral. "
,"That would only gain a short bit of time, but it would be enough to confront Erika. "
,"...The Chiester troops knew this, so they kept a close eye on {f:5:Virgilia} with tense faces. "
,"At that moment, ...the great cathedral door was blasted to bits. "
,The fragments became bright gold butterflies... which danced across the room in a beautiful blizzard of gold leaf... 
,That golden storm... ...slowly faded away... 
,"Then, ...at the entrance to that red-carpeted path to the grave... ...a calm, majestic figure was... "
Dlanor,"""Guards, shoot to {f:5:kill}...!!"" "
Chiester00,"""Negative, conducting identity comparison."" "
,"Dlanor ordered the guards to shoot the intruder right away, but Chiester 00 didn't respond. "
,Was it because she had been warned about shooting the guests... and was afraid of the consequences of possibly shooting a drunk guest pulling some sort of prank? 
,No. 00 was just coolly and calmly carrying out her duties. 
Furudo Erika,"""...Oh, what a surprise... And I thought you weren't going to make it."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
,The pair faced each other from either end of the long red carpet. 
,"However, in between them stood several dozen Chiester honor guards... "
Furudo Erika,"""It took you quite some time to come here, most honored guest!! You had us all quite worried! But I am glad you managed to make it to the reception at least...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Heh, ...heheheheheheheheheheheheh..."" "
,Beato...laughed... 
,That chuckle... ...made Battler's eyes quiver slightly. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Y- You......"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Did I keep you waiting? Furudo Erikaaa?! ...I'm here to celebraaaaaate...!"" "
,"She had an overpowering and evil presence about her, ...strong enough to make anyone shiver. "
,Was there really any need to confirm her identity now? Who else could possess such an overwhelming presence? 
Furudo Erika,"""B- {f:5:Beaaaaaaaa trriiiiiiiiiiiiice}!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""""Let us meet again in hell"" is a favorite parting line of mine, but-"" "
Chiester00,"""Identity confirmed. It is the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""This time, it really did happen, Furudo Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"" "
,"At that moment, the two Chiester troops standing behind {f:5:Virgilia} slumped over and fell to the floor. "
,...Ronove had touched the bases of their big ears from behind. 
,It was clear that he had applied some sort of magic. 
Ronove,"""Someone find a doctor. These girls appear to be ill."" "
Chiester00,"""<All Chiesters, open fiiiiiiiiiiire>!!"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Beato, now!!"" "
,"Just an instant before the Chiester troops could fire, {f:5:Virgilia} raised her arms to the heavens. "
,"Her magical power, which was more than enough to remind all present what her name had meant at the height of her strength, became a spirit wave that exploded throughout the cathedral. "
,"Its shockwave made the stained glass windows shatter, and colorful glass shards poured down everywhere. "
Chiester00,"""S-Spirit particle warfare defenses!! Hurry on reboot!!"" "
,"However, all of the Chiester honor guards, who didn't have spirit particle defenses, toppled over like dolls. "
,"The ceiling snipers were defended and able to avoid a crash, but it would take several minutes before the system could be rebooted. "
,......That span of time... ...should be enough to reach Erika... 
,"However, it wouldn't be possible to defeat Erika in just a few minutes. There was no way they'd be able to carry Battler away in that time...! "
,What else could they use this precious time for?! 
,Beato dashed down the red carpeted path. 
,"She ran down the path to the grave, which was lined by Chiester troops lying there like corpses. "
,"She had called this place hell. ...In that case, running from hell to the grave was actually going backwards. "
,Beato's figure dashing through the corpse-ridden path truly symbolized her resurrection...! 
Ronove,"""Milady, take this...!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Got it!!"" "
,"As she dashed, she snatched something white from Ronove's outstretched hand. "
,There was no longer anyone blocking her path to Erika...!! 
,"However, at that instant, a golden thread came from in front of her and rapidly sewed through the red carpet towards her like a sewing machine! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh, we have a meddler...!!"" "
Chiester410,"""Reloading complete, requesting data nyeh!"" "
Chiester45,"""Firing radar targeted. Data link to 410!!"" "
,410 was clever. 
,She had predicted that {f:5:Virgilia} would go for a spirit particle attack...and had folded her ears and 45's over beforehand. 
,"So, they were the only ones who weren't taken out. "
Chiester410,"""Firing!!"" "
,"Once again, the golden sewing thread chased after Beato, weaving like a sewing machine. "
,It was as though an undulating golden snake was shooting after her. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Impudence...!! You mean to delay my precious showdown with Erika...?!"" "
,"Beato jumped sideways away from the red carpet, then dashed across the long table covered with beautiful food. "
,"The gold snake chased her, sewing through the pure white tablecloth like a sewing machine and scattering dishes left and right...! "
,"The goat attendants ran about wildly, trying to escape. The cathedral was wrapped in pandemonium. "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...I can't believe some of those rabbits evaded the spirit particle attack...!"" "
Ronove,"""This is bad. If they take up that position, ...there's nothing we can do...!"" "
,"The pair of snipers, attacking from the chandelier high above, were much further away than Erika was—too far for Beato to reach. "
,"Furthermore, their position landed the entire cathedral inside their range of fire! "
Chiester410,"""...Too bad nyeh, {f:5:Beatrice}-samaaa. The trials of love are harsh nyeh! 45, new magazine!!"" "
Gaap,"""You mean this?"" "
,Gaap handed her the magazine. 
,"...45 always handed them over backwards, so 410 was a bit confused to have one handed to her the right way up... ...?!?! "
Chiester410,"""Nyeh?! Nyeh nyeh nyeh, let go, nyeh nyeh nyeh!!"" "
,"No matter how distant a position they might take, it was no problem for the elusive Gaap. "
,"Gaap twisted their long ears up, then tickled them with her thumbs. "
,The Chiester's greatest weapon was also their greatest weakness. 
,The two doubled over with laughter. 
Gaap,"""...I've got these two, ...but how many seconds do we have left? The other Chiesters will be reactivating..."" "
,"On the other chandeliers, even more powerful Chiesters were slowly starting to move again... "
,It would be impossible to buy any more time. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ah, Gaap! Thanks, I'm in your debt!!"" "
Gaap,"""Don't forget to thank these guys too."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Beato-, good luuuuuck, hang in theeeeere!!"" "
Ronove,"""You don't have much time!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"" "
,Beato cut through the crowd of scampering goats like Moses. 
,Her goal was straight in front of her. The place where Erika and Battler were seated...! 
,"Then, a red barrier took form, blocking her path. "
,It was the VIP-guarding barrier that Gertrude had set up. She stepped forward and laid out a last line of defense to block Beato's path. 
Gertrude,"""Let it be known that you will get no closer."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You think a wall like that can stop meeeeeeeeeeeeee?!!"" "
Dlanor,"""How long until the Chiesters {f:5:reactivate}?"" "
Lucifer,"""W-Within 30 seconds..."" "
,"As the oldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer stood in waiting behind the bride and groom. "
,"She wanted to save Beato. If she could just distract Gertrude for a moment, the wall would disappear... "
,"However, the Seven Sisters were furniture. They served the territory lord. "
,"So, they couldn't move to help Beato... "
,Dlanor glanced over at Lucifer. There was a coercive tint to her eyes. 
Dlanor,"""......You are not allowed to move except by the orders of your {f:5:master}."" "
Lucifer,"""......Nngg..."" "
Leviathan,"""Who's our master...?!"" "
Satan,"""It's Erika now, idiot...!"" "
Mammon,"""No, our master is Battler-sama!"" "
Belphegor,"""True. Erika only speaks on his behalf."" "
Asmodeus,"""That's right, Onee-sama! Whose furniture are we?!"" "
Beelzebub,"""It's just too delicious, ...let's dig in!!"" "
,"The red, absolute barrier flickered for just an instant. "
,"Beelzebub's stake had pierced Gertrude's shoulder, and her concentration had wavered. "
,...But it didn't break. 
,"Slowly and expressionlessly, Gertrude turned to look at Lucifer. "
Gertrude,"""...By whose orders? Know that Lady {f:5:Erika} has made no such order."" "
Lucifer,"""We do have orders. ...Th-The orders of our master!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............"" "
Gertrude,"""How can a master who cannot speak give orders...?"" "
Lucifer,"""E-Even though he can't talk, ...understanding your master's will is furniture's job!!"" "
Gertrude,"""Then, ...it cannot be helped."" "
,The Seven Stakes shot at Gertrude at once. 
,"...Gertrude had chosen to take all of those direct attacks, refusing to abandon the barrier until the last moment. "
,"Though she was resilient enough to be called a literal iron maiden and received no damage at all, it was more than enough to make her flinch and lose control of the barrier. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Good work, my furniture!!!"" "
,"Beato shot through the scattered, red fragments of the barrier, ...and she was finally right in front of the bride, her rival, Erika... "
,"However, there stood the final shield protecting Erika. "
,...Death Sentence Dlanor!! 
Dlanor,"""......You're too {f:5:late}. ...Time is already up, Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!!"" "
,"""Chiester 17, data link to <All Chiesters>. Incoming data from Archangel Satellite. Homing Format, Verdict-Model Conceptual Guidance."" "
,"""Chiester 20, reactivation complete."" "
,"""Chiester 127, reactivation complete."" "
Chiester410,"""Nihhihihihihi... Time's up nyeh. Nihhyahahaha!! No, not there, noooooooooo!!"" "
Gaap,"""......Riiche, good luck..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Be... ...a... ...to..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Keh, ...D-Dlanor...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Back off, Dlanor A. Knox. This isn't your fight."" "
Dlanor,"""...I have received a red truth denying you from Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}. ...I'm afraid that this will become your {f:5:grave}...!"" "
,"I don't know what {f:5:Bernkastel} has allowed her to say. However, I don't need to sit around and let that longsword tell me. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'll play with you all you want later. But for now, back off!"" "
,There's no time. The Chiesters have already finished reactivating. I'm only living on a bit of borrowed time. 
Dlanor,"""You will be the one to {f:5:retreat}...!! You are the pitiable actor who has chosen the wrong time to make an {f:5:appearance}!!"" "
,"Dlanor's red longsword cut a large arc of absolute denial, ...which headed straight for the crown of Beato's head. "
,"However, in that instant, there was *thunk*, and the curve missed slightly. "
,Beato didn't let this good fortune go to waste. 
,"She slipped past the longsword, ...knocked Dlanor aside, ...and finally stood right in front of Erika...! "
,"This time, not a single person stood in her way! "
Dlanor,"""Uuu...guh... ...This is... {f:5:popcorn}??? Wh-Where did this come {f:5:from}...?"" "
Cornelia,"""Urgent request from the bride's bodyguard team!! Let the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards fire at the intruder immediately!!"" "
,The commotion...quieted... 
,"...However, ...no one... shot. "
,...Why...? 
,They could have shot if they'd wanted to. 
,All of the Chiester troops had completely targeted her and removed their safeties. 
,"Of course, all of them had finished reactivating. "
,"...However, ...they hesitated to pull the trigger. "
Cornelia,"""Wh-Why aren't they shooting?! Let the ceremony guards immediately...!"" "
Dlanor,"""...W-{f:5:wait}. ...L-Look at {f:5:that}..."" "
,Dlanor's expression grew grim. 
,"...Then, she quietly...put her red longsword away... "
,"After all, ...Erika would have to make a decision. "
,"If she decided to ignore it, they could shoot to kill. "
,"However, if Erika picked that up, ...they must not do so. "
,"So, they couldn't pull the triggers until Erika decided... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Why won't anyone shoot...?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Look closely. ...See what Beato just threw at Erika?"" "
,"{f:5:Lambdadelta} pointed, still chomping down popcorn. "
,...It was hard to see from the balcony. 
,Beato had thrown something like a white handkerchief at Erika. 
,It had fallen to Erika's feet. 
,...What was that white thing...? 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...She really knows what she's doing, that girl. She knows what it means to be the main character."" "
Furudo Erika,"""How... ...interesting..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
,The thing that had hit Erika in the face and fallen to the floor... ...was a white glove that Beato had gotten from Ronove. 
,Hitting someone with a glove like that could only mean one thing. 
,It was... 
Furfur,"""Ooh, Zepar! What's this?! What does it mean?!"" "
Zepar,"""This is... ...a request for a duel!! If she picks up the glove, it means she's accepted!"" "
Furfur,"""And if she doesn't, the Chiesters will shoot? Why would she pick it up?!"" "
Zepar,"""She doesn't have to. ...However, we and the demon attendants would probably spread the word far and wide that she dishonorably ran away from a duel...!!"" "
,"""""She would be known for eternity as a coward who ran away from a duel of love!!!"" "
,{f:5:Beatrice} waited firmly and composedly. 
,If Erika just kicked it away... 
,"...Then at that very instant, ...the Chiesters would probably all fire at once, turning her into golden embroidery. "
,"So, Erika didn't have to pick it up. "
,"However, ...she could not afford to be afraid of picking it up. "
,"After all, ...she was the true victor, who had defeated Battler's closed room trick and logic. "
,"If she was the victor, she should have nothing to fear. "
,"So, ...if she was afraid of doing it, ...it would prove that she still felt a tinge of doubt about her victory... "
Furudo Erika,"""......If I don't pick it up, I can kill you without getting these clothes dirty."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That would probably liven up your reception. ...However, you will pick it up."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Oh? ...And why is that...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...I've brought a wonderful gift just perfect for you. ...You want to know what that is. ...Therefore, you'll pick it up."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Not interested. Goodbye."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...You'll pick it up. ...I know... that you want to hear about the closed room I've brought you... which, unlike that trivial guest room of Battler's, ...is simple, basic, ...and absolutely cannot be solved."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...A closed room... that absolutely... ...cannot be solved......?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...I know you want to accept my challenge. ......After all..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""............"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You are-"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},{a:c: The detective.} 
,Erika threw off her wedding dress as though it were a cape... 
,Yes. Before she is a bride or a piece or a witch... 
,She is one thing first and foremost- 
Furudo Erika,"""I...am the detective. ......I acknowledge you as my opponent. However, ...are you qualified to participate in this game? Have you managed to fix the logic error...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If you pick that glove up, I will prove that I have fixed it in my fight against you."" "
Furudo Erika,"""............"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........."" "
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>!!"" "
,Ooooooooohhh!! 
,The cathedral was filled with chatter. ...Erika...had picked up the glove. 
,A duel! A duel!! 
,The cathedral was wrapped in a bizarre excitement. 
,"At Erika's nod, Dlanor pushed the crowd away, leaving the pair alone. "
,...People were permitted to witness this duel. 
,"However, no one would be allowed to interfere in any way...! "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Uuughhh..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...It's okay, Battler-san. ...I've already found a way to save you."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""H... H... H... How...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'm going to save you now. Please hang in there just a little longer..."" "
,"Beato's resolute expression returned, and she grinned boldly, looking down on Erika. "
,"Ah, there can be no doubt... ...That's the expression worn only by the Golden Witch, ...the presence of the master of closed rooms. "
,A shadow dashed through the stormy rose garden. It was incredibly light and swift. 
,"The raindrops never touched him, he made no splashes in the countless puddles, his feet left no tracks in the mud. "
,That rushing figure...was Kanon... 
,"Then, he ran up the stairs... to the entrance of the mansion. "
,He did not slow down in the slightest to open the door. 
,"...He ran straight at it as though trying to break through, ...and leapt into it...! "
,"Though the door was shut, even that couldn't stop Kanon. "
,"He slipped through the door, fell into the entranceway, and slowly stood up. "
,His body wasn't even wet. 
,"...And, ...as he recalled those nostalgic days spent serving the Ushiromiya family, which would never come again, ...he ran once more. "
,He was heading for Battler's guest room. 
,"He ran past the servant room, through the entrance hall, and past the door to the parlor. "
,"Then, the doors to the kitchen and the dining hall came into sight... "
,All of it brings back fond memories. 
,...There was the honor and rigidity of serving Kinzo directly. 
,"However, that man wasn't rigid all the time. "
,"...When the family was out of sight and he didn't have to preserve that air of majesty, his face could turn unbelievably childish, and he would sometimes ask me to take part in strange pranks. "
,"......The Master let me shoot lots of guns, didn't he... "
,...That...was pretty fun. 
,Krauss-sama was actually surprisingly kind. 
,He must've gotten the impression that the Master bullied me a lot. 
,"Whenever I was the only one around, he would talk to me in a very familiar way, almost as though he was a classmate of mine. "
,...I sort of regret that I held back and never did anything but nod in return... 
,Madam was a really strict person... 
,"...Ever since some rumor went around saying that she was strict on female servants but soft towards male servants, I get the feeling she viewed me as an enemy. "
,"However, she was also a woman to be pitied. "
,"...When I've seen her alone, I've noticed her shoulders sag with the pain many times. "
,"There were a lot of servants, weren't there... ...Some lasted a short while, others stayed a long time. "
,Genji-sama was the one person I might have called my father. 
,...I am both grateful and resentful towards him over many things. 
,"...They all mix together, cancel out, and I end up with a neutral emotion. "
,"In that case, Kumasawa-san could probably be called my mother. "
,...She's helped me out many times. 
,"I've always wanted to repay her someday, ...and now I've lost that chance for all time. "
,Shannon... ...is my Nee-san. 
,"Without her, I wouldn't have been able to be me. "
,Thanks for teaching me that the ocean is blue... 
,...Gohda? ......I hate that guy. 
,"Still, when I complimented his stew, he would sometimes turn red and say there was enough for seconds. ...I didn't dislike that part of him. "
,I wonder why such a strong memory popped up at the instant I ran past the dining hall... 
,"And then, ...my memories of Jessica. "
,...Ooh. ...I-It's a boy servant... ...How...old are you...? 
,I think those were the first words she spoke to me. 
,"...Come to think about it, she was probably interested in me ever since then. "
,I really did...have enough time to build up a love that wouldn't lose to George-sama and Shannon's. 
,"But...since I could only see the gray sea, I wasted almost all of that time. "
,What does she like about me? What do I like about her? 
,I get the feeling we never really made that clear. 
,"...No, she told me. "
,We should've stayed together longer to eventually find that out. 
,...It would've been fine to find reasons for our love later. 
,...It took me... far too long... to realize that. 
,"......Now, I think I can accept it. "
,I know why Shannon won the duel. 
,God must have been watching. 
,"You had so much more courage than I did, and God didn't abandon you... "
,I reached the hallway with the guest rooms. ...There was someone lying on the ground. 
,"It was Battler. ...He was lying just outside the guest room, a chain tied to his neck. "
,...He had probably struggled to do something with the chain lock from the outside until he lost consciousness... 
,"His fingernails on both hands had been torn off, and they were stained with blood. "
,...I could tell at a glance just how hard he had tried until the final moment when his heart had died. 
,The collar binding him wouldn't disappear unless the chain lock was set. 
Kanon,"""...Battler-sama, ......it's all right. ...I'm going to save you now..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........!"" "
,Battler responded faintly. 
,He probably hadn't even imagined that help would come to this eternal closed room. 
,...He was so scared that this might be an auditory hallucination brought about by a fleeting delusion... that he couldn't bear to open his eyes easily... 
,Kanon grabbed Battler by the arms and dragged him into the room... 
,The inside of the room...was terrible. 
,"The windows had been brutally shattered, and the wind and rain had made its way inside. "
,All kinds of tools and furniture lay broken there. 
,"However, Battler hadn't smashed them out of rage. "
,"The curtain had been removed, torn, and twisted up into a bundle. "
,...He had probably used trial and error to see if that could be used as a rope for some trick. 
,"He had tried using everything in the room, exploring all possible options of escape. "
,"The traces could be seen throughout the room, and even in the bathroom. "
,"...The empty bathtub was stained with just a bit of blood, ...and the nippers lay there on the bottom. "
,"To protect this tale, ...he had nearly been prepared to accept {f:5:Bernkastel}'s brutal method of escape, cutting himself into pieces... ...and washing himself down the drain. "
,He was even willing to tear apart his own body... 
,"...To protect the game that Beato had entrusted him with, ...he had probably questioned himself over and over in this bathtub, wondering if there was any other way out. "
,"...By the clock of the game world, not even a single day had passed. "
,"...However, just how many years has it been in the closed room of the logic error? "
,"When faced with an endless span of time, any way of ending it, no matter how cruel, is tempting. "
,"......However, he had rejected that until the very end. "
,"And, ...even in the last moment when his heart died, ...he had wanted so much to show his iron will to escape from this closed room... ...that he had chosen to fall here in the corridor, ...with the chain still around his neck... "
Kanon,"""......Battler-sama, ...it's Kanon. ...Please, come to your senses..."" "
,He wiped Battler's face with a towel wetted in the sink. 
,"In response to that cold sensation, Battler's heart slowly started beating again... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Ah... ... ...I- It's you, ...Kanon-kun..."" "
Kanon,"""Yes, it's me, Kanon. ...You did well... ...to endure until today."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh...heheh... ...Looks like... I slept in... just a little too... much..."" "
,Battler realized that the feel of the towel on his neck meant that the cursed collar and chain were gone. 
Kanon,"""There's no longer anything binding you here. ...Come on. Please, head back quickly."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......B- But... ...if I unset that chain lock, ...that chain will come back..."" "
Kanon,"""Don't worry. No longer does any chain exist to bind you, Battler-sama. ...I will remain here."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What...did you say...?"" "
,"By now, Battler knew the terror of this endless closed room better than anyone else. "
,"So, he was more filled with shock than happiness, ...shock at the determination of the one who was willing to become the new prisoner... "
Kanon,"""I will be fine. There is no need to worry."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...B- But..."" "
Kanon,"""Battler-sama, isn't there still something you have to do...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I- I..."" "
Kanon,"""Go back, quickly. ...There is someone fighting in your place. And, there is someone awaiting your return. ...Will you not... ...go back?"" "
,His stern words and gaze...shot straight through Battler. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Are...you sure?"" "
Kanon,"""Yes. ...That will be fine. This way, I can repay my debt from back then."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Debt? Do you owe me something?"" "
Kanon,"""You aren't the one I owe, Battler-sama. It's okay, so go. I don't like being indebted to others. ...Go, quickly. ...You must not keep her waiting now. ...So...hurry."" "
,Battler couldn't argue back anymore. 
,"He silently bowed his head, ...unset the chain, and opened the door. "
,"Kanon had remained in the room, so no chain appeared about Battler's neck. "
,...He could leave this closed room just by running out... 
,The happy-sounding voices that he had heard at the far end of the corridor... ...had been replaced with an excited chatter. 
,There must have been some sort of strange disturbance going on. 
,"As Kanon went out into the corridor to see me off, ...the merciless collar and chain had already captured their new prisoner. "
,He would remain inside this endless closed room...in Battler's place... 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Kanon-kun, I feel the same."" "
Kanon,"""About what?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I...don't like keeping debts. ...I'll definitely repay you. And I'll do it soon."" "
Kanon,"""...I hope I can count on that... Go on. Run. ...Run to the one you love. And please, never get lost again...!!"" "
,Battler didn't turn back again. He ran with everything he had. 
,"He ran out into the corridor, whose warmth he had cursed so many times. That cursed chain no longer bound him. "
,"He ran to the very end of the corridor, ...beyond the light... "
,"Kanon, still connected to the chain, ...watched him go, then quietly returned to the guest room. "
,"Now, he only had to worry about his own job. "
,"Stay in this room, ...and fix the error in logic. "
Kanon,"""......Now, ...I set the chain lock..."" "
,"As soon as he set it, the chain disappeared from his neck. "
,"...Then, if he hid in the one place Erika hadn't checked... "
,......The broken logic would be fixed... 
,The closet door opened slowly. 
,"It was well-oiled, and opened without a sound. "
,"...It was cramped inside, and dark. "
,"This tiny space...is the last place I'll see. As long as I remain hidden in here, the logic will be preserved. "
Kanon,"""......That's an easy job. ...Easier than caring for the roses."" "
,Kanon went in it...and closed the double doors from the inside. 
,"...As soon as he did, ...a single small gold butterfly appeared, ...melted into the darkness of the closet, and vanished. "
,It was a sign that the logic had been fixed. 
,"The witch's game had already stopped, and the clock of the world of pieces would never tick again. "
,"So, for all eternity, ...no one... would come to save him from this place. "
Kanon,"""That's okay. ......This way, ...I've paid back my debt, {f:5:Beatrice}."" "
,"The power of the gold butterfly brooch taught me about love. In the third game, it gave me some quiet time alone with Jessica. "
,"...I get the feeling it did many other small things for me. At any rate, ...I've paid back all of my debts now. Now, all of my debts are... "
Kanon,"......That music tape Jessica lent me. ...I never gave that back, did I... "
Kanon,"That's okay, isn't it, Jessica...? {n}I liked that one. {n}Can I accept that as a present...? "
Kanon,"...You want me to dub over it and hand it back...? {n}Ha, ...hahahahahaha... {n}............ {n}...... "
,"Slowly, ...Kanon's body began to melt... into a cloud of gold butterflies... "
,"And, ...after the inside of the cramped, dark closet glittered like a golden planetarium, ...it faded away like the light of fireflies, ...and was painted over by a pitch blackness. "
,......For all eternity... 
,"In the cathedral, the goat attendants...were all jostling around either side of the red carpet. "
,"On the red carpet, standing across from each other, ...were Beato and Erika. "
,In their hands...were the pistols given to them by Zepar and Furfur. 
Furudo Erika,"""Flintlocks, are they? How old-fashioned."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Pay it no mind. Demons are very particular about style."" "
,"Its form was similar to an actual old-fashioned gun, but this was, of course, a demon's gun. "
,This wasn't a gun that would propel a lead bullet with an explosion caused by gunpowder. 
,"...Like the pistols used in the duel between Shannon and Kanon, whose bullets had contained a magic that would always kill, these pistols also had bullets that were not made of lead... "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...Beato..."" "
Gaap,"""There's no need to worry. She'll win easily, and you'll have to deal with her insults again, Lia."" "
Ronove,"""When this match is over, we should ask to be paid every now and then. ...After the fight ends, perhaps the occasional trip down to the Caribbean would be satisfactory."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Enough talk about ""when the fight is over""... That's an ill omen before a duel."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Beato! Take this seriously!! This is no time to be standing around laughing!"" "
Gaap,"""Why is Riiche relaxed and Lia tense? "
Mammon,"Come on."" "
,"""""""{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, you can do it!!"""""" "
Belphegor,"""...{f:5:Beatrice}-sama is at a disadvantage in this duel."" "
Lucifer,"""Why...?!"" "
Leviathan,"""...Normally, witches are able to use strength in numbers to achieve victory. However, since the game has been suspended, she has nothing on her side except ""the riddle of Battler-sama's guest room""."" "
Satan,"""If Erika can just strike a blue wedge through that one riddle, it'll mean she's solved everything!!"" "
Lucifer,"""They can win. ...I believe in {f:5:Beatrice}-sama... ...and Battler-sama, ...our two masters...!"" "
Dlanor,"""...Did you call {f:5:me}?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Thanks."" "
Dlanor,"""...?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""For once, ...it feels as though our chances of winning are 50/50. So I'd like to thank you beforehand."" "
Dlanor,"""It is simply my {f:5:job}. There is no need to thank {f:5:me}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...... ...In the last game, ...when you protected me after I lost pathetically, ...I was happy. "
Furudo Erika,"That was the first time in my life that anyone has ever protected me. ...Even my master has never done so. All she has given me is a way to cancel out my pain by exposing the truth of others, so that everyone ends up hurting each other."" "
Dlanor,"""...... ...Please, forgive my {f:5:arrogance}. ...I felt that I needed to protect {f:5:you}. ...When I realized what a frail truth you live by, when I saw you being tormented by the tyranny of a mixture of truth and lies that seemed more plausible, ...I wanted to protect {f:5:you}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Thank you. ......It wasn't for long, but you were a wonderful partner."" "
Dlanor,"""And will remain {f:5:so}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...You're right. Once we've defeated her, let's make tons of mysteries on this island together. I'll have you solve them, and tease you as we play. ...How does that sound?"" "
Dlanor,"""...I like {f:5:it}. I look forward to your {f:5:challenge}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ah, sorry, that's a lie. I take it back. ...That'd be one of those loser flags, wouldn't it?"" "
Dlanor,"""Pft-"" "
,"""""*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahahahahaha."""" "
,"""""Now, are you ready, duelists?!!"""" "
,"When the two demons clapped their hands, the duelists instantly returned to their bold, tense smiles. "
Furfur,"""The bullets within those magic guns are not lead!"" "
Zepar,"""They are bullets of red and blue truth for the battle between mystery and fantasy!!"" "
Furfur,"""As long as you possess truth, your bullets are endless!"" "
Zepar,"""However, being hit by a single one means instant death!"" "
,"""""Are you both prepared?!"""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Certainly."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Of course."" "
,"""""Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, o great and powerful Witch of Certainty and member of the glorious Senate, please come forward!! Will you swear to oversee this duel?!!"""" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Of course. I swear it."" "
,"The crowd split, and {f:5:Lambdadelta} walked forward with {f:5:Bernkastel} by her side. "
,She looked between the faces of the two duelists. 
,"Then, ...she took out an envelope with the seal of the One-Winged Eagle...and lifted it high. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""{f:5:Beatrice} has sent me her revisions to the tale inside a sealed envelope. After inspecting it, I find its contents to be valid. I proclaim that the logic error has been avoided!! 'The chain lock is still set! And without any contradictions with any red truth made up to this point!'"" "
,*chatter*chatter*chatter*...!! 
,...The many goat attendants knew the details of Battler's closed room. 
,They realized how difficult it was. 
,"And, though fiery debates had swept across the crowd during the reception, none had been able to find an answer. "
,"And now, ...it was clear that {f:5:Beatrice} had already reached one. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Therefore, this duel is legitimate. It will center around one, single point. The closed room of Battler's guest room! Battler disappeared from within a closed room sealed by a chain lock! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"Therefore, Erika has been armed with the blue truth. {f:5:Beatrice} has been armed with the red truth to counter back. ...The duel will continue until one side is victorious!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Splendid."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Perfect."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""OK. Well then, Beato. Present your new, revised tale and riddle to Erika."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kanon used magic to escape from the cousin room without breaking the seals. He reached the guest room and used magic to let Battler escape from that closed room."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Hmph, what a foolish tale."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Very well. Erika, is there anything you wish to confirm?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""The one who rescued Battler was, without a doubt, Kanon."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Very well. {p:1:The one who rescued Battler was, without a doubt, Kanon.}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""Battler and Kanon are different people."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'll say it. {p:1:Battler and Kanon are different people.}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Hmph. That's enough."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Erika, are you done confirming things?"" "
Furudo Erika,"""That was all I needed. I've already decided how to fight."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""OK! Let both sides load their bullets...!!"" "
,"Erika turned around, pressed her finger against the barrel of the pistol, ...made her blue truth into a bullet, and pushed it in. "
,"There was no rule saying that she had to turn away, but she didn't want her expression to be read. "
,"...Or, it might have been because she couldn't stand the tension of looking at Beato's bold smile. "
,Beato had already finished loading her red truth. 
,She waited for Erika to finish while calmly puffing on her pipe. 
,"Then, ...she looked at Battler, who sat on the throne of the territory lord, right next to the two witches who were here as witnesses. "
,......Battler's consciousness was still hazy. 
,"However, he apparently understood that Beato had come to duel for his sake, so that he could be saved. "
,"It was all he could do to just look at Beato with those sluggish eyes, ...but a flood of emotions passed between them. "
,...There was no need for words. A look was enough for them now. 
,"Erika closed her eyes tightly, ...her finger still up against the barrel. "
,"At that moment, her stunning powers of concentration made all the distractions of the outside world disappear. "
,...<Good>. 
,"It's always been like this, but my concentration really is good. "
,"Are you ready, me? Furudo...Erika. "
,"First, let's lay out the situation. "
,Battler disappeared from that closed room. The chain lock is set. 
,Did he disappear by magic? Of course not! There has to be a trick! 
,Kanon didn't save him with magic. 
,"He just came, took Battler's place, and set the chain. "
,...Everyone knows that much! 
,"The problem is the next step. No, it's actually the step before that one. "
,Kanon was in the cousin room in the guesthouse. 
,"That room was completely sealed with packing tape, and it's been proven that the seal was intact until the time of the logic error. "
,"In other words, Kanon escaped from a closed room that was absolute, with no chance for excuses or twisted logic. "
,<Good>! This is why she called it a simple yet ultimate closed room. 
,...How did he escape from the perfect closed room known as the cousin room? 
,"Heheh. If I got stuck thinking only about that question, I'd be no better than your average kid detective. "
,"...That room is a perfect closed room, so ""there is no way to escape"". "
,"In other words, trying to think of ways to escape from there is a waste of time! "
,The real question... is how Kanon was somewhere outside the cousin room when it was sealed. 
,"The cousin room is a completely sealed can. If he was in there when it was sealed, then it's already game over. "
,"In other words, ...at the time the cousin room was sealed, he wasn't inside it anymore! "
,Let's look at the time I checked everyone's locations and sealed the rooms. That's the most suspicious part. 
,"At that time, we have the five people in the next room over, whom I confirmed with my own eyes. "
,"Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo. "
,...I mentioned the names of those five people during the location check...and confirmed that they were in the next room over. 
,"Then, I checked to see whether ""everyone else"" was in the cousin room...and had that confirmed for me as well. "
,"I said ""everyone else"", so whether he was Kanon or Yoshiya or even Purupuru Piko-Man, they all should have been sealed in the cousin room. "
,"It seems perfect, at a glance. "
,"However, though that phrase ""everyone else"" seems perfect, ...it's fishy! "
,"Strictly speaking, ""everyone else""... refers to ""all humans whose names I did not mention directly"". "
,"In other words, there are exceptions! "
,"For example, ...it's been confirmed that Hideyoshi and George were in the next room over. "
,"So, humans with the name Hideyoshi or George ""{i:don't need to be inside the cousin room}""! "
,"It seems that Kanon told Jessica that his real name was Yoshiya, ...but that was no red truth. "
,"In other words, ...what if Kanon's real name is the same as one of those in the next room over?! "
,"They seem to be about the same age, so let's use George. "
,"So, what if there were two Georges in that room?! "
,"That doesn't violate the red truth saying that Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo are in the next room over. "
,Let's say that Kanon's real name was Tanaka George. 
,Both Ushiromiya George and Tanaka George could exist in that room at the same time! 
,"In other words, ...there were six humans with five names! "
,"It looked to my eyes as though there were only five people in the next room over, but a sixth person, Kanon, was hiding somewhere. "
,"I don't have the detective's authority, so it wouldn't be that difficult for him to fool my eyes and hide. "
,"I see, the double name trick... Stupid, so stupid...!! "
,"All right, I've made my logic!! "
,"Kanon, who was hiding in the next room over, not the cousin room, left by the window after the seals were placed- "
,*bang*!! 
Furudo Erika,"""Ah, ...owww..."" "
,"The gun had fired, and the tip of my finger was stained with blood. The blue truth gunpowder had exploded. "
,"...Ah, ...dammit... "
,...I've already... had Dlanor seal that one... ...a short while ago...... 
,"""Blue truth arguing about the window of the next room over is forbidden"", so I can't use it...!!! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Oh, an accidental discharge? Careful now, guns can be dangerous. *cackle*cackle*cackle*."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Sh-Shut up!! It's just a little mistake...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......The window of the next room over. You sealed it with some absurd trick, right? Gaap told me."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...I-Is that so? And so what?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Dlanor, remove that foolish seal. *cackle*cackle* That seal has become your shackles."" "
,Beato has figured out everything I've been thinking. 
,"And she's acting so confident, telling me to go ahead and use that argument...! "
Dlanor,"""...Lady {f:5:Erika}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...P-Please remove it. ...That fool, ...I'll make her regret this...!!"" "
,"""""It seems you are ready, duelists!! Please face each other with your pistols. "
,"Then fire with the sparks of truth!!"""" "
,"After facing away and readying herself one last time, Erika spun around. "
,"Beato had been facing her since the beginning. She wore a confident, challenging smile, as if she'd been kept waiting. "
,"Then, without any signal, the two slowly raised their guns, ...pointing the red and blue glints that hid within their barrels at each other. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Come. I could do with a little fun."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...Begin!!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""First is how Kanon escaped from the cousin room. ...I'll use that as my bullet!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh, so you'll start from there. ...Let's have it. Hold nothing back!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Here I go!!"" "
,"After holding the gun high and pointing it at Beato once more, Erika pulled the trigger with statements of red and blue truth. "
Furudo Erika,"""{p:1:The cousin room is guaranteed to be a perfect closed room until the end.} {p:2:So, if Kanon really was in this room, it would be impossible for him to escape! In other words, Kanon was not in that room at the time it was sealed!! The name ""Kanon"" is an alias. His real name is still unknown! If his real name happens to be the same as anyone in the next room over, that wouldn't contradict the check on who was in that room. In other words, it's possible for him to be in the next room over, not the cousin room!!}"" "
,"The goat attendants chattered and clapped their hands. ...Thinking ""Yes, such a move would work!"" "
,"Ah, I love watching this. I love being surrounded by this chatter. ...After all, ...I am the detective!! "
Furudo Erika,"""{p:1:It is true that the next room over was sealed, but at the time of the logic error, only the doors were checked to see whether the seals were preserved.} {p:2:Therefore, there is a chance that the window seals were broken. Kanon was in the next room over...and escaped through that window...!!} That is all!!!"" "
,Any other theory would be impossible!! 
,"If this doesn't work, ...then there's no truth left!! "
,"As soon as she said ""that is all"", both of them fired at the same time. "
,"...After the blast rang out, ...it was Erika's gun that fell to the floor... "
,Beato's red bullet had knocked Erika's gun from her hands. 
,"Was it...arrogance, or confidence? "
,"If she had just aimed that bullet at Erika's heart, the whole thing would've been over... "
,Beato had missed on purpose. 
,There was a bold smile on her face. It was as though she was offering to play with Erika a little longer. 
,"...No, that's exactly what made her Beato. "
,"{f:5:Beatrice}, the witch who mocks others with unsolvable closed room tricks...! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:At the time the next room over was sealed, Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo were in it. And, the number of people in the next room over was five. No one existed there except for those to whom those five names refer! All people can only go by their own names!!}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""......Uu... ...gkk... ... ......!!"" "
,It was a thoroughly merciless red truth... It was simple...and severe... 
,"Now that the number of people had been limited to five, any leeway for Kanon hiding there had been completely denied. "
,"Also, it was now clear that only people holding those five names existed within the room. Erika couldn't even make a new theory by suggesting that one person held two names, so that the five names referred to only four people, which would let an unnamed Kanon sneak in. "
,"Furthermore, the part about how people could only use their own names was a fatal blow that cut down countless theories...! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Come to think of it, you've only ever met the half-sleeping me from the previous game, haven't you...? What do you think, Erikaaa? ...How do you like the game of the Golden Wiiiiiiiiiitch...???"" "
Furudo Erika,"""That's insane... ...A-Are you saying... that Kanon slipped out of the room by magic...?! Ghh, ...gkk... ...M-More importantly, why did you just knock my gun away...?!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The human side must crush all of the witch's riddles, whereas the witch side need only crush the human's theories once. ...Don't you find that unfair? So, I decided to have it be even."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...E-Eveeeeeeeen...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I've decided that I'll make my victory condition the destruction of all of your theories. ...I've won the riddle of Kanon's escape, but there's one more! Let's return to the first battleground, where you gave Battler so much trouble!!"" "
,"When Beato snapped her fingers, that guest room of Battler's was reconstructed. "
,"She meant to fight once more in the room that had threatened Battler with a logic error, determined to settle things once and for all. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Erika, pick up your gun. ...We'll have this room be your coffin!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""......I say the same to you!! I'll make you regret... ever giving me this chance!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Witness, allow Erika to use X."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...X? You mean, a basis that doesn't need to be explained? What are you gonna let her do?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Let's give Erika permission to use blue truths for Kanon and this ""guest room trick"", without making her explain how he escaped from his closed room."" "
,"A theory explaining how Kanon saved Battler would also need to explain how Kanon escaped from his own closed room, or it would have no basis. "
,Erika had already lost that basis. 
,...Beato was giving her a handicap by saying that she didn't need to explain that part. 
Furudo Erika,"""...O-Of course!! You've already used the red truth to guarantee that Kanon saved Battler! It's only natural that I be given this privilege...!"" "
,Erika faced away again and concentrated even harder...! 
,"As though twisting the knob on a radio, she turned all noise and idle thoughts down to zero. "
,"Let's go, Furudo Erika. "
,"Detective, Furudo Erika! "
,"As long as Kanon reaches this place, rescuing Battler isn't hard. "
,The trick is as follows: 
,Kanon used some kind of escape trick X to reach the front of the guest room. 
,"While I was busy in the bathroom, ...Battler left the closet. "
,Battler undid the chain lock. {n}Battler went outside. {n}Kanon entered in his place. {n}Kanon set the chain lock. {n}Kanon went into the closet. The end! 
,...This satisfies the two red truths about the chain lock being set and Battler's absence. 
,"And, in exchange for this escape trick, Kanon remains inside the guest room. "
,...There's no room for argument on how tightly this room can act as a closed room. 
,That chain is cursed. 
,"In this demonic closed room, one person must remain as a sacrifice for it to be acceptable. "
,"...However, is such a simple theory really enough...? "
,"The rescuer switched places with him. {n}Then, the rescuer hid in the closet. {n}No other sort of theory is possible. And yet, Beato thinks she can win. In that case, ...does some other trick exist...? "
,It's impossible! 
,"I swear on the history of the mystery genre that there's absolutely, definitely, categorically no other way!! "
,"But if I give in here, I couldn't call myself a detective!! "
,"Consider it, imagine, don't stop thinking... That's how you drive blue wedges into witches!! "
,...What I can expect to see is...yes. 
,A wordplay trick! 
,"It can only be some kind of ""wordplay"" that just barely slips through the net of words spoken in red...! "
,"In that case, I'll crush all possibilities! I'll have them repeat line after line!! "
,"This final duel...has already begun, even though we haven't pulled our triggers yet...!! "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""At the time Battler was rescued, only Kanon entered the guest room."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I acknowledge it. {p:1:At the time Battler was rescued, only Kanon entered the guest room}. I believe that was the whole point..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""From the time I entered the room to the time of the logic error, Battler, Kanon, and I were the only ones who entered or exited the room."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:I acknowledge it. From the time you entered the room to the time of the logic error, you, Battler, and Kanon were the only ones who went in or out of the guest room.} "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""This refers to three people."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:I acknowledge it. It refers to three people: you, Battler, and Kanon}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Confirming definition. Can I assume that when you say ""three people"", that's equal to the number of bodies? You're saying that three bodies went in or out of the room, right?"" "
,I've had enough of things being mixed about with names and numbers of people. I want this point to be clear...! 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:Of course. Three people—in other words, three bodies—went in or out. Only you and Kanon entered, and only Battler left. It has already been said in red that all people can only use their own names. Therefore, the names Erika, Battler, and Kanon can only be used by those people}."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""I am not the rescuer."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:Of course}! You are the detective, are you not? Don't worry, I will respect that!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Confirming definition. ""How do you define rescuer?"""" "
,This is also important. I want to quickly remove the possibility that I rescued him accidentally. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:I'll define ""rescuer"" to mean any person who reset the chain lock after Battler unset it. This definition applies whether said person intended to rescue Battler or not.}"" "
,"Since she said ""after Battler unset the chain lock"", it's impossible for this to have occurred before I set foot in the room. "
,"From that point on, I wouldn't undo the chain again ""for all eternity"". "
,"After all, the game was suspended at that point. "
,"Therefore, it was impossible for me to have been the rescuer accidentally. "
,"More, ...I can focus it even more... "
,The chain can only be set from the inside. It's impossible for a person to escape on their own. 
,"Therefore, we know that Battler didn't escape by himself. "
,And I'm not the rescuer. Only Kanon can be the rescuer. 
,"And, Beato has already said that Kanon is the rescuer with the red truth. "
,...There's nothing to doubt. 
,There's no room for anyone but Kanon to be involved. 
,"...At least, so far! "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""Going in or out refers to when someone crosses the boundary between the guest room and the area outside it."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:I acknowledge it.}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. 'By the guest room, we're referring to the entirety of the bedroom, the bathroom, and the closet.'"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:I acknowledge it.} I've no intention of wriggling out of this by saying the closet isn't part of the guest room."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Confirming definition. The inside of the guest room is divided into three sections: the bedroom, the bathroom, and the closet."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:I also recognize it as such. Furthermore, you have already confirmed with the red truth that two of those sections, the bedroom and the bathroom, had no one hiding in them.}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Repeat it. ""There is someone in the closet."""" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I refuse."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Why's that?! Because Kanon is hiding there?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kanon can use magic. It's true that he hid himself in the closet for a time, but he then immediately vanished with his magic...! So, there is no one in the closet! I cannot respond!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""I ask you to repeat it once more!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Fool, the witch side has no obligation to explain how they did things with magic!"" "
,"...No, it's completely obvious. There's no way she can say that Kanon disappeared with magic using the red truth! "
,"After all, magic doesn't exist!! "
,But...is this...enough?! 
,"...I've gone through every last minor detail. And yet, there's an uncanny lack of dubious points. "
,I can't think of any way around the theory I've had since the beginning. 
,Kanon must be in the closet. 
,He has to be. There's no way he isn't! 
,I'll say it again! 
,This closed room can only be escaped from by switching places with a rescuer. 
,"If Kanon tried to escape as well, another rescuer would be needed. "
,"However, no rescuer exists for Kanon! "
,"Battler ""escaped"", so it's impossible for it to be him. And I won't undo the chain ""for all eternity""! "
,The people who have gone in and out of the room have been confirmed both by name and number of people! 
,"...At this rate, ...my theory... is set in stone. "
,"First, here are the details of the situation that are certain! "
,"{p:1:The game ended while I was inside the guest room, so I did not undo the chain lock that I had previously set.} "
,"{p:1:So, it can't be that he escaped after I left the room.} "
,"{p:1:Furthermore, the chain lock was set at the same time I entered the room. No one could have left the room during the few seconds between the time I entered and the time I set the chain lock.} "
,"{p:1:The guest room was sealed at the time Battler's ""corpse"" was examined, so until I came again and broke the seals, it was absolutely impossible for anyone to go in or out.} "
,"{p:1:Therefore, when I entered the room, it is certain that Battler was hiding somewhere inside the guest room.} "
,{p:1:The only chance Battler had to escape was after I broke the seals.} 
,"{p:1:To be even more specific, he had no chance to escape except for the time I was in the bathroom.} "
,"By the above premises, Battler's trick to escape with the chain still set is as follows! "
,"{p:2:Because of the aforementioned reasons, the only one who could've set the chain lock, which can only be set from the inside, and allowed Battler's escape... is Kanon, the only person to enter the room except for me and Battler!} "
,"{p:2:After Kanon entered the room, he set the chain, hid in the one place that he could hide inside the guest room, the closet-} ...Ah?! "
,"Whoa, that was close!! "
,"They almost got me, ...they almost tricked me!! "
,I thought I'd cornered him in the closet. 
,It's the opposite!! 
,They're trying to make me think he's in the closet! 
,What was the order in which I searched the guest room?! 
,"First, the bedroom. We confirmed with the red that there was nothing there. "
,"Then, the bathroom. We confirmed with the red that there was nothing there. "
,That's it right there!! 
,"When I examined the bedroom, there was nothing there. "
,"However, while I was investigating the bathroom, ...Kanon slipped out of the closet... and ""hid again"" somewhere in the bedroom! "
,"In other words, my guarantee that no one was in the bedroom...was torn apart during a span of one minute...! "
,"I've spotted it!! This is the witch's trap, an attempt to lure me into thinking that Kanon's in the closet...! "
,The place he's really hiding...is the bedroom...!! 
Furudo Erika,"""Heh, ......*giggle*... ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!! ...I've found it, ...I've finally found... your... trick...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
,That was a close one. 
,"If I'd been one step slower, I'd have said there was nowhere to hide except inside the closet, and then she'd just say that the closet was empty. "
,"Huh? ...N-No, wait... "
,It works the same way in reverse... 
,"I see, now I get it... It's a logic switching trick...! "
,"Damn that Beato... So, in resolving the logic error, she's discovered this strange trick!! "
,"If I only notice the closet, she'll have Kanon hide under the bed. "
,"And if I only notice the bed, she'll have Kanon hide in the closet. "
,"Even though either one would be right, I'd lose no matter which I chose. Unless I expose both at the same time, I can't checkmate her...! "
,Incredible... I've never heard of such an unfair trick... 
,"If it was a sleight of hand, it'd just be a cheap one. "
,"If it was a mystery, ...it'd just be cheating... "
,"However, in this witch's game, it's a legitimate... ...""logic trick""... "
,"In chess, it'd be called a double check. "
,"No, a discovered attack. ...Or wait, would it be a discovered double checkmate...? "
,"Even though this sort of logic would be a foul trick in the mystery genre, ...in this world where witches and mystery war, ......it is...such a refined board layout... "
,"The beautiful placement of the black pieces that cornered my white king felt almost like an art, ...so beautiful that, if I were a god in some old legend, I might wish to stick it in the sky as a constellation... "
,That beauty... ...even brought tears to my eyes... 
,"...For the first time, ...I felt honored... ...at being allowed to participate in this game of truth and witches as a human. "
,"And, ironically, ......it taught me, the one who had always believed in a single truth, that there isn't necessarily just one truth. "
,"If I just broaden my perspective, I can see completely different truths. "
,"...And though each of those truths are ""truth"", ...they're incomplete if they're all you can see... "
,"......In my life until now, just how many truths have I missed because I was blinded by some trivial truth... "
,......This is... ...the true nature of the world... 
Furudo Erika,"""...Because of our arrogance in thinking that only one truth exists, ...whenever we find one truth, we get blinded to all others. ......Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}-san. ......I never thought... that I would learn the true nature of this world from a witch."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
,"Slowly, ...with a soft and quiet gesture, ...like a flower opening with the morning dew dripping down its side, ...Erika raised her gun... "
Furudo Erika,"""It's my...victory. I've seen through your double check."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Then come."" "
Furudo Erika,"""... {p:2:""Battler's guest room disappearance trick"" is as follows. ...While I searched the room, Battler was hiding in the closet. Then, during the disturbance in the bathroom, he unset the chain and escaped from the room. At that time, Kanon was waiting for him in the hallway. Kanon entered the guest room in his place and set the chain. This is the trick to Battler's disappearance.}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""{p:2:...And, afterwards, ......he hid in the bedroom. This happened after I checked to see that there was no one unexpected in the bedroom, so it's valid. In this way, Kanon the rescuer concealed himself in the bedroom.}"" "
,"Erika's blue bullet flew in a strange arc, became a wedge of the blue truth, and pierced straight down through the bed and the floor beneath. "
,Beato didn't pull her trigger. 
,"...However, she did quietly argue back with the red truth. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:Kanon does not exist in the bedroom.}"" "
,Oooooohh... The goat attendants gasped. 
,"Erika had apparently been defeated, denied by the red truth. "
,"...For the goats, who couldn't see more than a single truth, it probably looks as though I've lost... "
Furudo Erika,"""Pft, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*... Next up is the real one. ...This is the answer from a Human capable of understanding multiple truths. ......It looks like the tale of illusions will end on the second twilight. ...So, why don't I carry out the remaining twilights... and open the door to the Golden Land. ......If you are to disappear, then it should be surrounded by your golden roses...!"" "
,"The fires of blue truth flashed at Erika's feet, ...and she loaded a blue truth bullet once more. "
,That overflowing blue power was now making her entire gun burn with a blue flame... 
,She wasn't aiming for Beato. She was aiming behind Beato. 
,......At the closet...!! 
Furudo Erika,"""Now that the bedroom has been denied, you've nowhere left to run!! Diiiiiiiiiiiiiee, Kanooooooooooooonnnnnnn!!"" "
,"The five wedges of blue truth she released shot right past Beato's cheeks, hair, and shoulders, ...then pin-cushioned the door to the closet to gouge whatever human was inside to death...! "
,The five wedges slammed into the door in a vertical line. In other words... 
,"On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill. On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill. On the sixth twilight, on the seventh twilight, on the eighth twilight... Gouge and kill and kill and kill...!! "
,"...After being gouged by so many thick and sharp wedges, ...the human inside wouldn't stand a chance... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Here's the truth I've exposed. ...That is all!"" "
,"When she proclaimed that she had finished, the five blue wedges piercing the closet disappeared. "
,"However, the many large, splintered holes left behind showed that it had indeed been pierced... "
,"Then, ...as though this completed the ceremony that led to the Golden Land, ...the room that had been created around them...became countless golden flower petals and drifted away... "
,"By now, the duelists and the crowd of attendants...were surrounded by the golden rose garden of the Golden Land... "
,"However, the closet behind Beato remained. "
,"...It stood there all by itself, like a coffin... "
,"...Then, as though teased open by a dreary wind, the hole-covered closet door slowly... ...opened... "
,"Inside, ......was a human figure... "
,That figure was covered up to the head by what appeared to be a grayish robe. 
,"...Of course, that also had large holes showing that it had been stabbed into... "
,"Eventually, it became clear that this was not a robe, but a raincoat. "
,"...If he had rushed here from the guesthouse, then there would be nothing strange about him wearing this into the guest room... "
,"...Then, ...with a rustle, ...the raincoat... ...lost its human shape, ...crumpled, ...became a cloud of gold butterflies, ...and disappeared... "
Furudo Erika,"""......Wh- What the... ......"" "
,"Inside the coffin of the closet, ...nothing remained except an empty darkness...... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:Kanon does not exist in the guest room. ......Of course, this includes all parts of the closet, the bedroom, and the bathroom.}"" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ah...... ......ah......"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kanon let Battler escape and hid in the closet... ...Then, he used magic to disappear. ......This is the witch's truth. ......That is all."" "
Dlanor,"""Th-This fight is {f:5:decided}...!! Say no m-"" "
,"""""And the winner is... ...{f:5:Beatrice}!!!"""" "
,"Oh, ...ooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhh!! "
,The attendants let out a cheer. {f:5:Virgilia}'s group couldn't help but scream and shout in joy. The Seven Sisters jumped about in celebration...! 
,"Then, at the same moment the two demons proclaimed {f:5:Beatrice}'s victory, the Head's Ring worn by Erika, who was slowly crumpling to the ground, and the cursed ring on Battler's finger...both burst. "
,"At the same time, Battler coughed violently. "
,Battler...was starting to regain consciousness...! 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!! Battler-saaaaaaaaaaaaan!!!"" "
,Beato latched onto the coughing Battler in joy. 
,"Then, {f:5:Virgilia}, Gaap, and Ronove did the same. "
,All of the Seven Sisters also crowded about him in delight. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Heh, ...heheh, ...what a nasty trick... Are you sure something like this will count...? With a trick like this one, those Humans will start complaining again about how this is no mystery..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No, it was a splendid trick! People without love cannot ""see"" it...! ...Battler-san, ......Battler-san, ...waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!!!"" "
Dlanor,"""Lady {f:5:Erika}, Lady {f:5:Erika}!! Someone, help her, {f:5:quickly}!!"" "

Gertrude,"""Search request to ceremony guards. Find Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!!"" "

Cornelia,"""...H-How cowardly... To think that someone's master... ...wouldn't watch her piece's duel until the end... ...Know that it is far too cowardly!!!"" "
,"Erika, who was being held by Dlanor, had already realized that her master was nowhere to be seen, ...but she didn't feel lonely. "
,"On the contrary, ...she was relieved that she wouldn't need to be brutally scolded in the last moments of her life... "
,"""""Gods and demons. Please pass on the story of her noble passing."""" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Noble...? ...Hah, ......the bad guy is supposed to die pathetically and make the main character look awesome... ...Ggh, *cackle*, ......ha...haha..."" "
,I'm not anyone's piece anymore. ...I can finally...control my own role...!! 
Dlanor,"""L-Lady {f:5:Erika}...!! Y-You mustn't {f:5:move}...!!"" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Stand back... ...Stay baaaaaaaaaaaaack!!"" "
,"When Erika yelled with all her soul, ...those who surrounded her were forced back and fell on their butts... "
Furudo Erika,"""I am... ...the Witch of Truth, Furudo {f:5:Erika}... ...The Witch of Truth...is the witch...who can withstand the truth. ...Now, ...I can finally...accept the real truth about myself..."" "
,The toxin of her own concept being denied raced through her. 
,...Her vision was already starting to blur. 
,"At the other end of her twisted range of vision... were Battler and Beato, hugging each other and looking at her... "
,Their expressions are firm. 
,...That's okay. 
,"Pity and sympathy would only make me look more pathetic. ...For a loser, that sort of expression...is the best... "
Dlanor,"""Lady {f:5:Erika}...!! The duel is already {f:5:over}...!!"" "
Zepar,"""It isn't."" "
Furfur,"""Not until the pair is separated by death."" "
,"""""We won't let anyone disgrace her final moments."""" "
,The two demons grabbed Dlanor's shoulders and held her back... 
,"Dripping blood, ...breathing heavily, ...and with an awkward gait, ...Erika walked towards Beato and Battler despite it all... "
,"As the blood dripped from her, it became golden flower petals, which drifted away. "
,"...So, as she walked, ...she looked both divine... ...and beautiful. "
,The duel wouldn't end until one of them died. 
,"So, even though it had been settled, ...it hadn't ended. "
,"Beato and Battler told the people bunched around them to step back, ...and they both walked forward to face the noble loser... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Erika..."" "
Furudo Erika,"""...Congratulations on your resurrection. Looks like you have bad luck with women. ...You'll never get a decent one to like you..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...True. ...And I'd never fall in love with a decent woman."" "

Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Erika..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Very well. ...We are not so boorish as to refuse your noble request."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Thank you."" "
,"As her consciousness began to waver, ...Erika raised her gun again. She pointed it at the two of them. "
,Beato also...raised her gun to point at Erika. 
,"Then, Battler placed his hand on hers... "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""If it's already resolved, ...what more could there be to argue about...?!"" "
Ronove,"""...Erika-sama......"" "
Dlanor,"""Why... is there nothing I can do... at a time like {f:5:this}...?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...Watch until the end. That's your job as her friend, isn't it...?"" "
,Both sides silently loaded their bullets of truth without saying a word. 
,The color packed into each barrel...was red... 
,"So, though neither side spoke, ...did they both know what trump card the other would use...? "
Furudo Erika,"""......Now, ...at the end, ...I'd like to finally introduce myself..."" "
,What's she saying? This late into the game... 
,No one could imagine the red truth Erika had loaded...

Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I understand. ............"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Let's at least pull the final trigger together."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I know..."" "
,Battler placed his hand on top of the finger that Beato had around the trigger.

Ushiromiya Battler,"""We will... be together... for all eternity."" "
Furudo Erika,"""Ahhah, you just had to flirt right in front of me!! It's pissing me off. ...You know, I really can't stand teary farewell scenes."" "

Ushiromiya Battler,"""...That's a nice look. ...Married life with you would probably have been fun enough to make me vomit."" "

Furudo Erika,"""You've never looked cuter than you do now. ...I guess both of us really do need to finish it this way!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Come."" "
Furudo Erika,"""This is detective Furudo Erika's final parting line... and self-introduction!!"" "
