Speaker,Steam (ST)
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You idiot!! Isn't it obvious?!! It'll be fun to kill her and see your face twist in pain, why else?!! Gahyahahahahahahaha!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it. Look, look, look! It's magic, it's furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look, look, look, look, look! Gyahhahhahahaha!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Sorry, Battleer. It was pretty fun. Sure, I just did what Teacher told me, but look how great it turned out! Apparently, if you start out all hostile and needlessly brutal, then turn incompetent and soft at just the right moment, you can spark a huge bump on your affection meter, ri-ght? Kyahahahahahaah!!"" "
,That lonely tone...was the desolate sound of the wind blowing by. The glittering rose petals on these bushes...were all golden. 
,The cloud of gold butterflies that had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals... was no longer anywhere to be seen... 
,"The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. She might be called inhumane and cruel. Arrogant and outrageous. Or perhaps...naive and simple. "
,"That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard. "
,"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}... sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden itself. "
,...She wasn't relaxing there. 
,"Her eyes were empty. She didn't respond to any questions. Even so, she was not permitted to sleep. {f:5:Beatrice} sat like a doll... "
,"Her hair was down, and {f:5:Virgilia} was carefully tending to it with a comb. "
,The usual Beato would surely have spent this time complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle. 
,"...However, she made no response, showed no reaction. So it really only looked like {f:5:Virgilia} was combing the golden hair of a large doll... "
,There was a table alongside them. 
,"On it sat a chessboard, ...along with a jumble of black and white pieces locked in a closely-fought battle. "
,"However, this setup looked somehow different from normal chess. ...Maybe the game was similar, though not identical. "
,"And on the other side, ...sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man. "
,"...No, perhaps it wasn't his next move he contemplated. "
,"Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation after every change. "
,"Maybe he was reconstructing previous games, trying to discover the thought process behind the moves that had been made. "
,"In the past, Kinzo, the Ushiromiya Family Head, once said that learning chessboard arrangements was like taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters. "
,Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey. 
,A search for the thought process...that had led the Golden Witch to create this arrangement and make these moves. 
,"Battler took a black piece that should have been moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply. "
,"Battler's pieces were white. However, on this chessboard, the black encampment was on Battler's side. He was reconstructing that arrangement, trying to play Beato's role... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...The more I do this, the less I understand your moves."" "
,Even Battler...didn't expect that Beato would respond to that statement. 
,"Or rather...he was pretending to talk to himself, ...thinking there might still be some chance of her responding. "
,Beato's eyes...reflected nothing. And her mouth told nothing. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""....................."" "
,"After begging him to kill her, ...the Golden Witch had become a corpse that had given up on life. "
,She wasn't sleeping. ...She couldn't step down from this game and was therefore forbidden sleep. 
,"So, those words must have reached her ears. However, ...they probably hadn't reached her heart. "
,"The Golden Witch would not sneer at Battler's moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them. "
,"By now, ...{f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a living doll. "
,"Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while. It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless. "
,"Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture... or even move her lips. "
,"However, her movements never managed to communicate anything to Battler... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""How did you decide on this move in this situation? ...I don't get it at all. I don't understand your moves."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".................."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...Beato, Battler-kun is talking to you..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".................."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Say something. Giggle, or guffaw, or something. ...Even use that shrill laugh of yours, if you want."" "
,...Can you believe it...? That shrill laugh of Beato's...will never be heard again. 
,"However, even if she couldn't answer, his voice surely reached her. ...That was what Battler believed as he said these words. So he said it again... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""How did you decide on this move in this situation? I don't get it at all. I don't understand your moves."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""............ ...So, you don't understand what this child is thinking?"" "
,{f:5:Virgilia} answered in her disciple's stead. 
,"Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato. After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and {f:5:Virgilia} didn't want to be the one to steal that chance. "
,"...So, Battler was going to have to bear with this silence... ...until Beato herself answered. "
,{f:5:Virgilia} could no longer bear to watch Battler like this... 
,"Besides, Battler also wanted to hear what {f:5:Virgilia} had to say. He believed that conversation would reach Beato's heart... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yep. I don't have a clue. ...The more I try standing in Beato's shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand."" "
,"A serial murder following an epitaph. With that as a victory condition, I tried reconstructing the games from the witch's side, ...but I never ended up making the moves Beato did. "
,"In those games, I could find several incomprehensible moves that clearly worked against that victory condition... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I don't get it at all. This journey through her thoughts is just too rugged."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Even so, you won't give up, will you?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I won't. ......I promised."" "
,{a:c: Kill...me. ......Let me die......} 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I promised to let her die peacefully. ......And I'm the only one who can do it."" "
,"...Beato's right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle. "
,"It wasn't tied to anything, so it didn't restrict her movement. "
,"However, it symbolized restriction. It was a visualization of the bonds...that prevented her from leaving the game until she either won or lost... "
,"And, ...the shackle was probably hurting her. The mercilessly cold shackle... tormented her over and over inside her waking dream. "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Ghh.........ah..."" "
,"So, there was never any sign of relief in her empty expression. Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a nightmare, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp. "
,"Unless I win, ...Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from sleeping peacefully... "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...Are you sure you want to be doing this? It seems the 5th game has already started."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............ ...Not interested."" "
,"Why should I take part in any game unless Beato is my opponent...? If that's the only alternative, then it's a much better use of my time to reconstruct previous games while taking a journey in search of Beato's thought process... "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""I'll be the next Game Master. Any objections? You've got none, right?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...I've got nothing but objections. Beato conceded the fight and is unconscious. Isn't this a loss by default and ""game over"" for her...?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""I'll admit a lot's happened to Beato, and she's basically been KO'ed for now. But that doesn't mean she's lost the will to fight. That's why I'm acting as her assistant. Get it?"" "
,"Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping. "
,"However, she wasn't sleeping, ...and she wasn't awake either. "
,"She was nothing more than a living doll that had given up on victory, who had asked Battler to perform her last rites, and who had surrendered everything... "
,"Of course, if everyone just sat around, the next game...the 5th game would never be made ready. "
,"So, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had succeeded Beato as the next Game Master and announced that she'd prepare the next game. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Quit messing around. This is a game between me and Beato. I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna let you carry on without us."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""No one asked for your opinion. What'll you do, Bern? Accept my challenge? Or not?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............ ...Sure. Go ahead and inherit her role."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The hell... Quit messing around! I don't know who you people are, but I'm not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hey, take it easy. Okay, sure, a new player means you'll face new kinds of moves. I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff that confuses you, but even that might lead to some big hints, get it?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Who cares!! Quit saying whatever you want and deciding everything on your own!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Beato's game has repeated four times, and you still don't understand anything, right? In that case, I expect that swapping out opponents might lead to some huge hints."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's none of your business! This is our game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent. I don't know what hole you two crept out of, but I don't want you screwing things up!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready. Can you...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...B-Beato won't be getting up for a while. Anyway, we don't even need to have another game. The four games she's already laid out are more than enough!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""And even if we do have some fifth game, there's no reason it shouldn't just be a puzzle Beato lays out and I take on. There's absolutely no reason for you two to butt in!"" "
,"Battler couldn't hide his irritation at the two witches called {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had shown up well after the game's start, and who were now trying to take charge on their own... "
,"It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato... So high, in fact, that even Beato's teacher, {f:5:Virgilia}, couldn't even come close. "
,Battler had the feeling he'd seen these two several times before. 
,"However, this was the first time he'd known their names and spoken to them directly. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""You can't get the next game ready without waking Beato. That's why I'll prepare the next game!"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""We aren't so patient that we're willing to wait forever for Beato to regain consciousness. Right, Bern?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I don't like boredom. It really ticks me off."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""We really don't give a damn whether you're bored or not."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Come on now. Leave everything to this <perfect> {f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama, okay? I'll take over as the Game Master. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"{f:5:Don't worry}, I won't play with too much ""absolute perfection"". {i:Just like Beato}, I'll set up plenty of incomprehensible fakes, clues, and bonus hints. I'll make this game a huge hint that'll help you understand Beato's world even better, okay?"" "
,"Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard. "
,The two witches didn't flinch at all. 
,"...One grinned. The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened. "
,The two of them just stared at me silently. ...As though they were reproaching me. 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""What's this? Not satisfied? Are you saying you'll step down from my 5th game? Isn't that a loss by default?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Battler won't step down. Of course he'll participate in the 5th game."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't just decide that yourself!! I'm not gonna play along with you two. I don't give a shit!"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hmmm... ...Then it really is a loss by default, right...? The witch side wins this game. Is it really okay to end this with the Humans surrendering...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......If you step down, the game will end with your loss by default, get it? ......If you wanna guarantee that your lonely sister always meets with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, that option is indeed open to you."" "
,"When {f:5:Bernkastel} mentioned Ange, ......Battler's expression changed instantly. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Y-You bastard, don't you dare talk about Ange so lightly..."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Because you have an ally in me, {f:5:Bernkastel}, the Witch of Miracles, ...there exists the possibility of a miracle in which Ange's family comes home to her. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"Well, if you do throw that chance away and guarantee that Ange's endless futures all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting too."" "
,I vaguely understood what she was saying. 
,"Until I win in Beato's game, I'll remain trapped in this bizarre world. "
,"And if I abandon that victory, ...then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange. "
,"For Ange's sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me, I must keep on fighting... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Nng, ......d-dammit......"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......What's wrong? You look unsatisfied. Have you already forgotten how angry you were...when your sister was turned to mincemeat...? "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"You know, that spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red-hot pliers. You'd better watch more closely next time, okay...?"" "
,"{f:5:Bernkastel} pointed the palm of her right hand upwards. ...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue-glowing crystal appeared there. "
,"...A scene was reflected on its sharp surface, ...but it wasn't the scene that surrounded them now. "
,"If you looked deep into that crystal, ...that Fragment, then you would probably learn what was reflected on there. "
,"If you stared at it, then you'd surely see the end Ange finally reached......after waiting 12 years and giving up everything for the sake of her beloved brother. ......The scene of her death throes...as her entire body was torn to bits while she still lived. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...D-Damn...you......!"" "
,"Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar, but as soon as he touched that which made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves. "
,"Then, as naturally as though she'd been there from the beginning, {f:5:Bernkastel} was leaning against a distant wall. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......If you step down from the game, this'll become not just a Fragment, but a definite reality. I won't be the one to create that future. You'll do it yourself. ...So decide, okay? Figure out what you wanna do with your beloved little sister's future."" "
,"Battler's fists shook with anger, ...but even if he swung them down, he wouldn't be able to hit {f:5:Bernkastel}. "
,"This witch was like a phantom, or a cat who wouldn't even let someone pet her if she didn't wish for it. "
,"And, ...she was telling the truth. For Ange's sake, I can't step down from this fight. Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Heheheheheh. That's just like you, Bern. You're even heartless when you threaten people. ...That's how it is, Battleeer. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"You aren't allowed to step down from the game board. You and Beato are nothing more than pieces on the board that exist to distract us from our boredom. ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to satisfy us."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Well, what you're doing now only makes for a cheap snack though."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Like those curry-flavored potato wafers that sell for 30 yen a pair."" "
,"""""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!"""" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Y-You damn...witches..."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......*giggle* Fight for Ange's sake, okay? And for Beato's too, right...?"" "
,"In a way that was admonishing...or perhaps babying, ...like the headache you get after eating something too sweet, {f:5:Bernkastel} tormented Battler and smiled. "
,"By now, the host of this tea party, Beato, was absent. ...The guest witches were already making themselves at home. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...What'll you do, Ushiromiya Battleer? Will you surrender to fate...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".................."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Just step down. You've had enough of being toyed with as a witch's piece, right? Heheheheh, it sure is tough being one of Bern's pieces. I'm sure she'll use you and throw you away just like she did with Ange. Geheheheheh!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I'm not giving you the option of stepping down. ...Keep fighting for the sake of your sister's future. I'm your ally. Until you win, I'll support you so you can reach that future. For all eternity, until I get bored. ...*giggle*giggle*."" "
,I can't let her provocation and cajolery rile me up... 
,"These witches know I get mad easily, and they're trying to take advantage of that... "
,...Battler withstood it all...and finally relaxed his clenched fists. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......If you wanna start this 5th game of yours, ...go ahead and do it. Do whatever you want."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Yes, I will do whatever I want. ...Hey, where are you going?"" "
,"Even though Battler acknowledged this 5th game, he turned his back on them, much to {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s surprise. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If you're gonna be Beato's substitute, ...then I'm sure that {f:5:Bernkastel} witch over there can stand in for me if she wants."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Not a bad idea. Better than a loss by default."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""What the heck?! Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?! Rude, ruuude!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Battler says he's going to take a break for a while. Until he comes back, I'll be his substitute. How's that sound...? Battler...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You do that."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""............"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...What's wrong, Lambda? So, you'll refuse to play if it's against me, instead of that fool Battler...?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ehheheheheh!! Of course not{p:0:♪} I'm glad I get to play with you, Bern! Come on, let's play, let's play! Let's play together in {f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama's super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......This technically is a world Beato created. You aren't going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Don't worry about that. I'm really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff. I made sure to use a Beato-ish atmosphere to make a tale that's even more interesting."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break's over, okay? It'd be a shame to miss this. I've set up plenty of bonus hints that'll get you closer to Beato's secrets{p:0:♪}"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...Or at least that's what it'll look like, when it's actually filled with misdirection that makes stuff more and more confusing. Wait, hey, Battleer! Why aren't you listening when a witch is talking?!"" "
,"Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness. "
,"After shrugging and cackling, the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato...... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Can those witches really understand Beato's game?"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...Since they're using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do. However, they can do things that this child wouldn't do."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......... ...What do you mean, things she wouldn't do?"" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""The materials of chess exist so that you can play chess. You ""cannot"" use them to play cards. However, when it comes to throwing chess pieces at your opponent and scribbling on the board, "
{f:5:Virgilia},"...such things are not impossible to do. However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess, so people ""choose not to"" do that."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},""".................."" "
,That definitely...wouldn't be chess anymore. Beato's eyes seemed to cloud slightly with sadness. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Damn them. ......This game's between me and Beato. ...I won't let anyone else defile it."" "
,"At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea. "
Ronove,"""Would you like some more tea?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......If you wouldn't mind."" "
Ronove,"""Certainly. ...So, how goes this journey of yours in search of Milady's thoughts?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I don't have a clue, but I'm enjoying it."" "
Ronove,"""However, ...are you sure about this? Is it truly all right for you to relax here?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...You mean that game those witches just started all by themselves?"" "
Ronove,"""Indeed. Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place, and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."" "
,"When Beato and I were playing, the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats. "
,"...However, those witches wouldn't pause that game just because I wasn't around... "
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Ronove, did you see their game?"" "
Ronove,"""Just a part of it."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""How was it?"" "
,Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea. 
,"After finishing that, he finally spoke. He gave us his impressions of it. "
Ronove,"""It...did not have love."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...What do you mean, love?"" "
Ronove,"""My apologies. That is how a woman might put it. ...As a man, ...one might call it dishonorable."" "
,I understood what those words meant. 
,"When I met {f:5:Virgilia}'s eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor... "
Ronove,"""......I believe it resembles Milady's games greatly, on the surface. However, its foundation is quite different."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Does it go against the rules of Beato's game?"" "
Ronove,"""No, it does not. {f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama actually does understand the rules of Milady's game very well. ...However..."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""..............."" "
,Battler stood up. 
,There was no need to make Ronove say any more. 
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Battler-kun..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Sorry, Ronove. I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn't what I need."" "
Ronove,"""So, you will go after all?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah. ...We don't need any outsiders in our game."" "
,...These guys weren't even here in the beginning. 
,"Because I've been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced, ...and now they've hijacked this game between me and {f:5:Beatrice}. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I've gotta take it back. ...Right now, I'm supposed to be the one taking care of Beato's game board. ...That means I can't just sit around here."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Thank you. I wanted to let this child hear those words."" "
Ronove,"""I'm sure she hears them. ......Milady is simply unable to answer."" "
,"Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes... "
,The game board she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people... and was being turned into a mess... 
,If I was designated to be her opponent... ...Then Beato must have created this game for me. I've...got to take it back. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Wait here. I'll go and take it back."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""....................."" "
,"Of course, Beato didn't respond in any way. ...That's right. If she can't respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'll be right back. ......{f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove. ...I'm counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping beauty."" "
Ronove,"""Yes. Leave it to us."" "
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...See you later, Battler-kun. And please, ...in the game without this child, try to find some part of her. If you can, ...then even if this child is absent, it will mean you have fought with her."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You're right. ...Aaah, ...it's all useless. What am I doing?"" "
,Let's go. ...And let's take it back. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!! My break is over!!"" "
,"When he faced the jet-black heavens and yelled this, the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass. "
,"Then, ...as though it had been that way since the beginning, ......it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked. "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""What do you think you're doing? You're only coming back now? It's way too late! Not only has the game reached the second day, it's already at the finale, get it?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."" "
,"Yeah, like you even waited for me in the first place... "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Bern was waaay more skillful and thrilling than you were. Right?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Shut up. I'm the player. You substitute witches can just take a step back now."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Well, I don't really mind if you join in starting now, but there's probably no need for you anymore."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Seriously. After all, we're already at the climax! After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What the hell......?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Nothing wrong with that, is there? Why don't we let him watch the final endgame?"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Of course. Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler. It's almost completely over, but here's the <cute> and <elegant> game I made! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},Episode 5. End of the Golden Witch! 
,"Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor. "
,"And, with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder. "
,"And, the culprit is among these people. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Whoa, whoa. ...That means...it's conclusive, isn't it...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...It was you?! You killed George, killed my husband?! Why?!! Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...I-I didn't kill anyone...! I-I...d-didn't...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..............."" "
,"In a panic, and with a voice that was far from calm, ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly, ...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her... "
,"However, ......there was no longer any way around it... "
,"{i:She} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time. "
,"""...You're the culprit, Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san."" "
