Speaker,Steam (ST)
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!! Fall, fall, faaaaaaaaaaalllll!!!"" "
,"Once again, Captain Kawabata's ferryboat to Rokkenjima cut across the sea in perfect form. "
,"Yes. The tale of October 4th, 1986...always begins with Battler's screams. "
,"But this time, one thing was different. There was another yell alongside Battler's. "
,Battler was screaming. The other was...laughing? 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Fall, fall, faaaaaaallll!! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Fun, fun, fuuuuuunnn!! *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Battler's face looks funny!! *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!"" "
,"Alongside the big brother, who was grasping at the handrail and screaming in a way no one that age should scream, was the little sister, also grasping the handrail and jumping about like it was a ride at an amusement park. George and the others just couldn't hold in their laughter at the difference. "
Ushiromiya George,"""I guess Battler-kun hasn't changed much these past six years. He's as energetic as ever."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Plus, Ange and Maria look more cheery than usual this year."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Could this be the first time we've had all five cousins together?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Oh, is it? I get it. That explains why it's noisier this year than any year before."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""G-George-anikiiiiiiiii!! This is way too fast, right?! I'm begging you, ask the driver to slow down before it's too laaaate!!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihahahahahahahaha! This is too fast? Battler's so pathetic!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I wanna go faster!! Faster, faster! *giggle*giggle*!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Any faster than this, and I'll fall right off the boat!! Will that make you happy?! I'm gonna faaaaaaaaaaaalllll!!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Hahaha. Going by popular vote, I'd have to say that Battler-kun's proposal is-"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Rejected! Ahahahahahahaha."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Look out, Onii-chan. Look, you're gonna fall! Ahhahahahahahahaha!!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Scaredy-cat Battler needs to be punished!! Tickle time! Kihihihihi-!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""W-Wait, stop, Maria!! You too, Ange! N-Noooooooooooooooooooo!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Thank goodness. I was worried about Ange's health, but..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It'd be too sad to leave her behind at home. I'm glad we decided to bring her anyway."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wasn't she very sick shortly before you left?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""She was all better this morning. Kids can be so incredible sometimes."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""She's the kind of person whose health takes a hit when she's stressed! It's not that strange for people like that to get all better when the big day finally comes."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""She must really have been looking forward to playing with all five of the cousins together."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohoho. Just watching them play together makes you feel charged with energy, doesn't it?"" "
,The adults smiled as they watched the children play around. 
,"Ange, who had gotten very sick, and who everyone had thought would be absent, made a miraculous recovery. "
,"Thanks in part to her strong desire to join in, she had come along to the family conference with the others. "
,And so... 
,"For the first time ever, all five cousins were gathered together. October 4th, 1986, became a day like no other. "
,The kids dashed up the path leading from the harbor to the rose garden. 
,They were probably so charged up that even walking was too boring for them. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wahhahahaha! See that?! First place!"" "
,"Battler was the first one to reach the rose garden, which was the goal. "
,"Apparently, he was trying to make up for the dishonor he had suffered on the boat by proving his superiority on land. "
,"A short while later, Ange and Maria reached him in a dead heat. "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I'm second!! I'm faster than Ange, uu-uu-uu-!!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No, you aren't! Maria onee-chan cheated!! I'm second!!"" "
,"The three year gap between Ange and Maria was large, especially since both of them were growing kids. "
,"It was only natural that Maria was faster, but Ange seemed to be complaining about a shoulder bump at the start line. "
,"Maria onee-chan cheated, so she gets last place! Teacher always says you get last place if you cheat! ...Protested Ange. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Come on, no need to fight. Still, both of you really are fast...!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's been a long time since I've run that much... Ah, the breeze feels so nice."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Are you out of shape, George-aniki? You know, anyone who has to run the race-to-make-it-before-the-bell every day gets strong legs by default."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""In other words, being a fast runner is proof that you sleep in a lot."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Onii-chan always sleeps in! He didn't wake up today either, so I had to wake him up! Right?!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""A stomp followed by a flying elbow. And that body-plex from the top rope at the end there just about finished me."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That sounds more likely to put you in an eternal sleep..."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Sounds fun! I wanna do it too!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'll bet Onii-chan sleeps in tomorrow too! We'll wake him up together this time, okay?! *giggle*giggle*!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...I'd recommend against staying up too late tonight."" "
,"Finally, the adults came into sight. "
,"The cousins waved at them, urging them to hurry up. Ange and Maria were so excited that they could hardly wait. "
,Just by having all five cousins together... Just by adding Ange into the group... 
,Look at how energetic this day has become. 
Shannon,"""Excuse me. The family members have arrived."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""So, they made it. I must let Father know."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Are they all in the guesthouse now?"" "
Kanon,"""Yes. They will meet you here after they have set down their luggage."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Understood. Kanon, please show them the way. Shannon, quickly get some tea ready."" "
,"""""As you wish, Madam."""" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Father. It's me, Krauss. It's about time for you to get ready."" "
,"After Krauss knocked on the door, it opened from the inside. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Oh, Doctor Nanjo. How is Father doing?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""No need to worry. He's changing as we speak. I think he's just a little nervous."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Who are you calling nervous?!! Nooo, I cannot find my favorite One-Winged necktie pin! How many times must I tell Natsuhi? My possessions must never be moved without my approval...!"" "
,"Apparently, Kinzo had been running around for some time, just because he couldn't decide on a tie and a tie pin. "
,"Kinzo, who felt that the dignity of the Family Head must always be preserved, usually made a big deal about the Head's attire being equally dignified. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Will he make it in time?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Do you think you could give us a little longer? We'll come down as soon as he's ready."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Understood. I'm counting on you, Doctor Nanjo. ...Father, I must say, that necktie pin looks splendid on you."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""This necktie pin, you say?! This pin?!! The family conference is held but once a year! There shall be no compromise! I must have ""that"" necktie pin!! Where is it, ...where?!!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Kinzo-san, you already looked in that drawer five seconds ago... Besides, you own several splendid necktie pins. Is it not stylish to select something fitting to match fate's whims?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmmmmmm, you think so? So, I don't need to use the One-Winged Eagle pin...? Hmmmmm..."" "
,"As Krauss watched Nanjo calm Kinzo down, he started finding it hard to believe that this doctor wasn't his own mother. "
,"Well, it was always like this. "
,"He always makes a fuss when no one's looking, but when the time comes, he makes his decision with pride. "
,"After asking Nanjo to come down by lunch at the latest, Krauss snuck out of the study... "
Gohda Toshiro,"""What do you think? A splendid aroma, is it not?! And a unique one, as well!"" "
Shannon,"""I've never had pumpkin tea before... That little touch of sweetness makes it delicious."" "
,"As one step in preparing the tea for the guests, Gohda let Shannon try a bit first. "
,"Until then, Shannon had thought it would be outrageous for a servant such as herself to drink the same thing as the family and their guests. "
,"However, according to Gohda, that kind of thinking was a mistake. "
Gohda Toshiro,"""One must not serve something if one does not know the taste beforehand. ...For example, when you visit a restaurant and a dish you've never heard of catches your eye, what are you likely to ask the waiter? ""How does this dish taste"", correct?"" "
Shannon,"""I see... So, if the waiter says that he's never eaten it before, that would seem a bit odd..."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Precisely. As a matter of course, anyone serving their customers must be deeply acquainted with the taste of the tea and food they serve."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohoho. And, you'll always feel happier serving a sort of tea that you've tried and enjoyed for yourself."" "
Shannon,"""That's right. After tasting tea this delicious, I can't wait to let everyone else try it."" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""And because of that! We servants must be very familiar with the tastes of all sorts of foods. That's why ""sampling"" food whenever I can is part of my job description, ...hohoho."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""It's a perk as well as our job. Do you understand?"" "
Shannon,"""Yes!"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""...Everything is proceeding smoothly. Are there any problems with the tea?"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Oh, Genji-san, you must try some as well. Seeing as it's almost Halloween, I decided to make some pumpkin tea."" "
Ronoue Genji,"""Later, perhaps. The family will be arriving at the mansion very soon. ...It looks as though the children will be joining in."" "
Shannon,"""Yes sir. The cups are ready to go as well."" "
,"At that moment, the kitchen's extension line started to ring. "
,"Genji, who was standing right beside it, swiftly picked up the receiver before the second ring. "
,Shannon and the others always thought Genji looked like a samurai when he did this. 
Ronoue Genji,"""...Understood. Take care when guiding them."" "
,"After giving that short response, Genji set the receiver down. "
Ronoue Genji,"""That was Kanon. The relatives will be here shortly. The children are with them. Shannon, Kumasawa, go to serve them. Gohda, hurry up with that tea."" "
,"""""""Yes sir!"""""" "
,The family conference. It was the largest event of the year for the servants. They were all excited and determined to make it through together once again this year. 
Kanon,"""Krauss-sama, I have led the relatives here."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Oho, there you are. Were there any troubles on your trip here?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nii-san, you've been doing pretty well for yourself lately, haven't you? Isn't it about time you bought a private jet?"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahahahaha. After all, no one was in the plane but the family, as usual!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I'm glad Ange-chan made it. I was so worried when I heard she was too sick to come."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Thanks for your concern. She suddenly got all better this morning."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""My tummy ache went away! I rubbed my tummy clockwise!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-uu-! That's a magical ritual to heal tummy aches!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Now, Maria, quiet down..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Oh, is that Battler-kun...?! You've grown so big!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""It's been six years, hasn't it? You've grown splendidly."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Well, ...ihihi. I do keep getting bigger, at least..."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Can't really say that about his guts though!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I'm just happy to learn that he's still the same old Battler-kun."" "
,"Wahhahahahahahahaha. Battler may be bigger, but he's still Battler. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""This brat's always been terrified of falling off planes and boats and stuff."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That must be Asumu-san's blood, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""When he was a kid and we went to theme parks, we always went on some of the wilder rides. That's probably what did it."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Don't they have height restrictions for those?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""No, I don't mean that kind. You know those paddle boats and teacup rides, right? Looks like we took those a bit too rough back in the day."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""You've always gone a bit overboard on rides like that, Rudolf nii-san."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I see... Poor Battler-kun."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Haha, poor Battler-kun indeed."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Still, it's comforting, in a way. Even after all this time, nothing says ""Battler-kun"" like a fear of riding things."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Onii-chan isn't scared of riding things. He's just scared of falling off them!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Faaall, faaall!! Uu-uu-uu-!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Hey, stop running around...! Maria! You're one of the big cousins now, right? Set a good example!"" "
Shannon,"""Pardon me. I've brought some tea for everyone."" "
,"A pleasant aroma followed Shannon as she came into the room, pushing a serving cart. "
,"Even Ange and Maria, who had been running around in circles, sat down obediently when they heard that drinks were here. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""By the way, what's Dad doing?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""He should be down here soon. He's been rushing about all morning trying to choose a tie."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You mean, all that about choosing ""an attire suitable for the Family Head""?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Father's always been picky about ties, hasn't he?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""It's just something he has a passion for. Staying stylish is a good thing."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""And yet, he always shows up wearing the same tie in the end."" "
,The family members burst out laughing. 
,"The sweet scent of Gohda's specially-made pumpkin tea spread throughout the parlor, and the calm atmosphere grew more cheery and excited. "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Look, Mama! Look, Mama! It's a pumpkin cookie! For Halloween!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Oh, that's right. This sweet scent is kabocha, isn't it?"" "
Shannon,"""That's right. Today, we have some special pumpkin-flavored tea for you to try. It really is delicious, so I suggest you try some without sugar first."" "
Kanon,"""Nee-san, watch your sleeve."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Wow, so kabocha tea actually does exist. Gohda-san really did his homework."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Delicious. This is excellent. You can taste the kabocha's natural sweetness."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Kabocha tea, huh? Still, kabocha always tastes best in tempura!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-! It's ""pumpkin"", not ""kabocha""!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah, pumpkin is different from kabocha! This is pumpkin!"" "
,"Maria was apparently speaking in English, but Ange, being normal, was not. Maria seemed to think the English word was more fitting for Halloween, but it looked like Ange thought kabocha and pumpkins were entirely different things. "
,"Everyone laughed, but Ange, not knowing why she was being laughed at, cocked her head to one side discontentedly. "
,"Just when it looked like she was about get in a bad mood and start grumbling, Maria started teaching her a ""cookie game"", and Ange immediately became engrossed with that distraction. "
,"Then, the sound of approaching footsteps drifted in from the hallway. "
,"When the relatives realized whose footsteps those must be, they straightened up. "
,Those quick footsteps stopped for a moment just outside the parlor door. 
,...As though someone was taking a deep breath and setting up a dramatic pause. 
,"Then, the door exploded open as Kinzo yelled out loud, with Genji and Nanjo standing behind him. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""<Hhhhhhappy Halloween!! And trick-or-treeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaat!!>"" "
,"""""""<Trick-or-treeeeat>!!"""""" "
,"The cousins shouted it back. The adults returned the greeting too, looking embarrassed and refusing to meet his gaze. "
,"Ange alone stood there with her mouth open, unable to comprehend what had just happened. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Welcome, my grandchildren!! If you don't give me a treat, I shall trick yooooou!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Go ahead, Maria."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Happy Halloween, Grandfather!! I got you a really incredible one this year! You'll be surprised!!"" "
,Maria picked up a present that had been hidden behind a sofa. 
,"Come to think of it, all of the relatives were now holding similar packages. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Come on, Ange, you too. Give this to Grandfather."" "
,Kyrie handed Ange a neatly-wrapped present. 
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ooooooh, Mariaaaaaaaaa, you're always so thoughtful!! Grandpa's so happyyyyyyyyyy!!"" "
,"As Kinzo took Maria's present, a smile broke out across his face, and he rubbed his cheek up against it. "
Ronoue Genji,"""...Master, your dignity."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Nngg... O-Oh, that's right. ...You have pleased your grandfather greatly, my granddaughter. In return for the treat you have given me, I promise not to trick you at all this coming year."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Now it's your turn, Grandfather!! If you don't give me a treat, I'll prank you!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Indeed, I'm well aware. Genji...!"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""Here."" "
,"Genji fished through something that looked like Santa Claus's sack and pulled out a present addressed to Maria, handing it over to Kinzo. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Heeere you go, Mariaaa!! Here's a present from meeeeeee!! I'm warning yoooou, it's so cuuuuute!! Such a waste to give it up to you{p:0:♪}"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""......Master. Dignity."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Nnngggyyyyhhhh... Th-This is a present from the Ushiromiya Family Head to Maria... It is a...cute...nnnggg, *cough*cough*. An item worthy of the Ushiromiya family's dignity and grace. T-Take good care of it..."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Thank you, Grandfather!! I love you!! *kiss*kiss*!"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""N-Nngggwoooooooohhhhh...!! Ooohhh, Mariaaaaaaa, my adorable granddaughter!! *kiss*kiss*!!!"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""............"" "
,"By this point, even Genji had to give up on Kinzo's dignity. "
,"Still, the dignity of the Family Head had lasted a full ten seconds longer than usual this year. "
Ushiromiya George,"""Happy Halloween, Grandfather. This is from me."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Happy Halloween. This one's mine. I hope you like it."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oooooh, George, Jessica, I must thank you once again this year. I'm...so happy..."" "
,"With tears streaming down his face, Kinzo hugged George and Jessica. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oh, and Battler too. ...I'm so glad you've returned to the family. ...It's been lonely without you, these six years..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Well, ...um, anyway, ...Happy Halloween. Not sure if you'll like it though..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Don't worry, ...don't worry, Battler... I know you have things you want to say, things you want to ask. ...But now is not the time."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Grandfather..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""I am...glad that you have returned to the Ushiromiya family... ...It makes me feel...happy..."" "
,"Slowly, ...Kinzo moved forward and hugged Battler. "
,"Battler drew back at first, but then he understood Kinzo's feelings and hugged him back. "
,"Ange watched this scene play out, ...shocked. "
,Was Ushiromiya Kinzo...always this kind of person...? 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Ange, you're up."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Go on, give it to Grandfather."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Ah, ...okay."" "
,Ange...didn't have a clue what was going on. 
,She took the present her mother had given her...and walked forward timidly. 
,"...Kinzo's face, which had looked so cheery a second ago, suddenly became stern as soon as Ange stepped forward. "
,"No, it didn't ""become"" stern. "
,That expression...was the one always worn by the Kinzo inside Ange's mind. 
,This was Ushiromiya Kinzo. 
,"He was fickle, short-tempered, and always wore a stern expression on his face. ...This was the most terrifying person in the Ushiromiya family... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""............"" "
,"It felt as though the world went suddenly quiet, and it only did it when I stepped forward. "
,...Why? Why only for me? 
,"But, ...isn't this how it should be? Isn't this the Ushiromiya Kinzo I expect? ...The Ushiromiya Kinzo I understand...? "
,"I was like a puppet carrying a tea tray. I walked forward, bewildered, with the present held out in front of me, ...and stopped in front of Kinzo. "
,"Without letting his expression change in the slightest, Kinzo slowly reached out and touched the present... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""AAAAAaaaaannnggeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"" "
,"In an instant, Ange was caught in a firm embrace, present and all. Kinzo's white beard rubbed against her cheek. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Grandpa...Grandpa is so happyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!! I'm so glad to be blessed with such lovely grandchildren!! I feel happyyyyyyy!! So happy the tears just won't...just won't stoooooooooooop!!"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""...Master, your nose is running. ...That...and your dignity."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oh, Genji, forgive me!! I...alwa{0}n{0}t{0}h{0}f{0}n{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hnnn... *sniffle*!!"" "
,he didn't look like he could possibly be anyone other than a kindly grandpa overcome with tears at his grandchildren's gifts. 
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Thank you, Ange. I heard that you chose to come even though you weren't feeling well at all... I'm so glad...! Here, this is for you."" "
,He pressed a large gift box to Ange's chest. 
,...She finally realized that all of Kinzo's presents were wrapped differently and in boxes of different sizes. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I wonder what he got you, Ange. I hear that Grandfather always personally chooses what he'll give each one of us. Pretty incredible, with all these people."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......He picks them himself. ...Every year. ........."" "
,He does... what every year? He picks... what himself? 
,This bizarre ceremony happens...every year. 
,The cousins were all happily chattering about what their Halloween presents would be this year. 
,"Maria came up to Ange and suggested that they compare the weights of their presents, but for some reason, Ange just stared blankly. "
,"After that, the adults also handed their presents to Kinzo one by one, receiving a gift in return, along with considerate words about their health and questions about how they'd been doing recently. "
,"Then, after watching to see that all exchanges had been completed, Gohda appeared... and announced that lunch was ready. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ah, is it ready...?! Come, ladies and gentlemen! Let us enjoy the splendid lunch that Gohda has prepared for us. Quickly, to the dining hall!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""This way, everyone. Follow me."" "
Shannon,"""We will carry your presents to your rooms in the guesthouse."" "
Kanon,"""Please, feel free to leave them here as you leave for lunch."" "
,"The relatives stood up, leaving their presents where they lay on tables and sofas, and followed Kinzo out of the parlor. "
,"...Only Ange remained standing there, stunned, ...as she clutched the present Kinzo had given her... "
,Gohda's lunches had never betrayed expectations before. 
,"When Hideyoshi said that these meals were the only reason anyone ever came to these family conferences, everyone laughed and nodded. "
,The delicious food caused conversations to erupt all over the room. 
,You've gotten so big. How have you been lately? Pretty good. 
,"It was a fun meal, with everyone asking each other about the latest and laughing together. "
,"The Ushiromiya family sat at meals in a specific ranked seating order, so the adult siblings, the cousins, and the spouses all sat in groups. "
,"So, conversations sprung up naturally. "
,Ange had withdrawn slightly from the cousins' chat and was looking around the dining hall. 
,...What are Kinzo and the adult siblings doing? 
,Their conversation seemed to be peaceful and fun. 
,"Most of the time, the siblings were mothers or fathers of their own households. "
,"However, when they gathered together by themselves in front of Kinzo, that burden was lifted from their shoulders, and they became young and bright as though they'd gone back to being kids again. "
,"Rudolf, who was usually an easygoing father who nonetheless had a sense of dignity, became so bright and cheery in this group that it almost looked like there was another Battler. "
,Even Kinzo looked peaceful and relaxed. 
,He didn't say a word about money or the inheritance. 
,"In fact, he didn't even insult his children or call them incompetent. "
,"He just looked like a happy old man, genuinely pleased to have his whole family together for the only time this year. "
,The group of spouses was just as harmonious. 
,"The mothers kept bringing up problems with education and household matters, as well as family health issues. "
,Hideyoshi and Nanjo happily joined in on their conversation. 
,And what about the cousins? 
,...There was no way such an enjoyable meal with such a fun group of friends could fail to be raucous. 
,"Maria was in her element, showing off her knowledge of Halloween trivia. "
,"George and Jessica would nod in understanding, Battler would say something stupid, and Maria would laugh at him. "
,"If I wanted, I could easily join in on that conversation, and if the dessert caught my attention, I could easily slip out of the conversation too. "
,"It was...happiness, both fun and natural. "
,...It felt like waking up from a daydream to be greeted by the rays of the springtime sun. 
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""According to the weather report, we can expect a big storm sometime tonight."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It's supposed to be a typhoon. Looks like we'll be stuck here for more than one night again."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""I do not mind in the least. You may stay here as long as you wish. If it would mean seeing my adorable grandchildren's faces more, I would pray for rain every day."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Give us a break. We do have work to get back to."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Why don't you leave the island, Father? That way, you could see your grandchildren whenever you wanted."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hahhahaha, true. Living on a remote island may have a sense of majesty, but haven't you had your fill of it?"" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...It's too noisy in the city. I much prefer a quiet island, with no one on it but my family. I like it here."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""But on Rokkenjima, if something happens, it would take some time for a doctor to arrive."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I agree. At your age, I think you should at least consider moving to Niijima."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...I am old now. I want to live in peace, surrounded only by my family. ...And I am satisfied. I have this island to make that dream of mine come true."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Father..."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmm... It seems I've gotten you all down. Ladies and gentlemen, this ends Gohda's lunch. Grandchildren, it will probably be raining constantly starting tomorrow. Now is your last chance to see clear skies. Why not enjoy the flowers and then take a walk on the beach?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""That sounds good. Okay, everyone. Let's go."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-! I wanna see the flowers and walk on the beach! We can collect shells, and collect glass too!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Collect glass? That, uh, sounds a bit dangerous...!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Fragments of glass get washed by the waves and become round, beautiful gems, which drift to shore. Did you forget, Battler? Remember how we used to pick them up together?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh... Were those glass fragments? I always thought they were just pretty stones."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Have you ever seen a glass gem, Ange?!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...No."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Then let's go!! I'll show you!! Let's go, let's go! But the first to see them gets to keep them! I'm gonna get them all!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Heheh, in that case, I'm not gonna lose either. Let's see who can find the prettiest, biggest glass gem!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""All right! At times like this, why not be a kid?! I'm not gonna lose either!"" "
