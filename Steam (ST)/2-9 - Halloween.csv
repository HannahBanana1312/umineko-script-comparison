Speaker,Steam (ST)
,"...What is that sound that always fills my ears? Is it the sound of the rain, the sound of a waterfall, or could it be radio static? "
,"If not, I want it to be the sound of blood flowing through my body. ...I want it to be the sound of the blood circulating throughout me, telling me that I am still alive... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........Nnn... ...Is it...morning...?"" "
,"The light entering through a crack in the curtain was faint, but it at least told him that dawn had broken. "
,"Kinzo, still in the position he'd been when he woke up, ...still sitting in a chair and looking up at the ceiling, ...felt the blood slowly travel throughout his body... "
,"...Judging by the clock, it was early morning, 6:00 on the dot. ...No matter how tired he was, no matter how deeply he slept, he always woke up at exactly this time, as though he had measured it with an hourglass. "
,"He didn't think of this as something to boast about, but he told himself that, as long as he could still manage this, his health couldn't be that bad. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Morning has come, which means... ......hmmm. ...It would appear I've avoided becoming one of the first sacrifices. ...Was I merely lucky when the roulette was spun, ...or is this the fruit of my efforts? How irritating that I cannot tell the difference, but I mustn't be bothered by such trivialities."" "
,Kinzo was struck by a faint desire to see beyond the study door. 
,"After all, he might find the traces of someone's vain struggle to break through the door, a sign that someone had tried to select him as one of the first six sacrifices. "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""...Hmph. ......Humans are cheap creatures. ...Even though everything is ultimately decided by God, when humans are given good fortune, they arrogantly feel it was due to their own ability."" "
,That was why he wanted to check whether there was a wretched mark on the door. ...The very desire was human. 
,"And that was why Kinzo did not check. He often rejected desires that came to him because he was human. By doing that, he could be immersed in a feeling of sufficiency, as though he himself had become a being that surpassed humans... "
,"He recognized human desires for what they were...and guarded against them. Things that a human would want to do, he resisted. "
,"...This eccentricity and rebellious nature had surely given him a rare genius, making it possible for him to succeed in his exploits as he revived the Ushiromiya family in a single generation... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}. What were the six pieces you took? ...And, what will your next move be? ...Entertain me. ......My defense is perfect. I will not shame myself like last time. ...Heh, ...heheheh."" "
,"The servants woke early. They had to open the curtains, prepare breakfast, and complete various other tasks to welcome the guests to a new day. "
,Gohda was the most enthusiastic. 
,"During the family conference, he had been told to concentrate his efforts especially on cooking, and he'd been specially exempted from several tasks that servants normally must do. "
,"...Gohda, who was a show off, seemed to be feeling particularly superior because of that. He let Genji and the rest prepare the rest of the mansion...and worked on making breakfast in the kitchen. "
,"Genji split the work with Shannon and Kanon, and they carried out various tasks. "
,Shannon headed to the dining hall and knocked. 
,"...Last year, the family conference had continued into the early hours of the morning. It wouldn't have been odd if this year's conference had done the same. "
,"Considering the possibility that they were still having a discussion inside, she knocked. "
,"But there was no response, so she opened the door and said good morning. "
Shannon,"""...Good morning. ......Is anyone there?"" "
,"The room was cold, and the conference seemed to have ended a long time before. "
,"There was a tea set on the table from which they'd probably been drinking, arranged in a way that would make it easy to clean up. "
,"Cleaning up the tea was a servant's job. If the family members were extra generous and cleaned it up themselves, the servants would lose face. "
,"So, it was a truly pleasant act of kindness for the family to do only this much. "
,"As she approached the table to clean it, she noticed something like a memo that had been left near the utensils and cups. "
,"Since it was right next to the tea set, Shannon picked it up, naturally thinking it was a memo for the servant doing the cleaning. "
,"Written there was not a request, nor was it thanks for preparing the tea. There was just a single word. "
,Shannon looked at it blankly and read it out loud... 
Shannon,"""......Chapel. ......?"" "
,"A small sound kept repeating over and over. Normally, that sound would've been too trivial to be worth caring about. "
,"If only I could stop hearing it soon, I could go back to sleep right away, ...she thought vaguely. "
,"...But no matter how much time passed, the sound did not end. It repeated over and over. "
,"Aaah, shut up. Who is it? Banging on the door this whole time... "
,"As soon as she realized that, she woke up. ...Someone was knocking. "
,"Then, she noticed that it wasn't just a knock, but a voice as well. "
Ronoue Genji,"""......Rosa-sama, ...Rosa-sama. ...Good morning."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...W-Wait. I'm coming now."" "
,"It had been Genji's voice. Looking at the clock, it wasn't even 7:00 yet. "
,...It was clearly too early to wake the guests. ...Did something happen that was bad enough to cause this? 
,She felt her sleepiness increasingly fade thanks to this premonition of misfortune. 
,"Though Genji was a servant, Rosa had known him since her childhood days, so even though she was slightly defenseless in her pajamas, she opened the door a crack and answered. "
Ronoue Genji,"""Good morning. I apologize for waking you this early."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Did something happen?"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""Yes... ......Actually, at the chapel...... "
,Genji...whispered something into Rosa's ear. 
,"For a second, it seemed Rosa couldn't understand what she'd been told. After having it repeated several times, she realized that apparently, something strange had happened. "
,"Rosa closed her door for a second, changed her clothes quickly, and followed Genji towards the mansion... "
,"The chapel requires some explanation. It wasn't in the mansion, but in a grove behind it, a short walk's distance away. "
,"It had been built at the same time as the mansion, so though its walls had been repaired many times, making it look new from the outside, it was a very old building. "
,"Rosa dashed through the rain along with Genji. Just like the previous night, the rain was falling in earnest. "
,"Eventually, the chapel came into sight from beyond a thin grove... "
,"Just looking at it from the outside, it seemed a place of dazzling beauty, where a pair of young lovers might want to get married. "
,"However, Kinzo apparently viewed it as a very sacred place, so Rosa and her siblings had been given strict instructions not to approach it unnecessarily. "
,"Even though they were all grown up now, approaching the chapel for any reason would still make them feel guilty... and also afraid, as if their Father might get angry and hit them in the face... "
,"The servants' silhouettes could be seen in front of the chapel's entrance. Gohda, Shannon and Kanon. "
,...Which meant that all of the servants on the morning shift had gathered. 
,"A short while ago, Genji had spoken to Rosa, telling her what the situation was. However, ...without laying eyes on it directly, she definitely hadn't been able to understand... "
,It was probably the same for all the servants gathered here as well. 
,"...{i:Without seeing it with their own eyes}, they wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on. "
,"On the door at the entrance to the chapel... was something very large, ...drawn with a creepy, stringy paint that made one think of blood... ...Something like a creepy magic circle. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Wh‐ What is... ...this...? When was it drawn here?!"" "
,The servants looked at each other. Gohda was the first to open his mouth. 
Gohda Toshiro,"""...M-My apologies. We don't usually enter this building, so we don't know when it was made."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Then who was the first person to find it?!"" "
Shannon,"""I-It was me. ...When I went to the dining hall to clean up the tea set, ...I found a memo with ""chapel"" written on it..."" "
,Shannon held out the memo with a shaking hand. 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Whose handwriting is it? It isn't Nii-san's or Nee-san's. ...So, after that, you came here and found this, right?"" "
Shannon,"""Yes..."" "
Kanon,"""...Rosa-sama, ......look at this."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""What? <......Happy Halloween...for...> ...What?!"" "
,Kanon pointed at a single line of English written below the creepy magic circle. 
,"Until it had been pointed out to her, she'd thought it was just another part of the magic circle. "
,"There, the following words were written in English: "
,<Happy HALLOWEEN for MARIA.> Happy Halloween... For Maria... This creepy magic circle... was for Maria. <Happy Halloween.> 
,"Yesterday, only one person had said <Happy Halloween> to Maria... "
,"The key phrase matched. ...It was the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...! "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Wh-What about Maria?! She should be sleeping with her cousins, right? Did you check?!"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""...My apologies. We just now realized that Maria-sama's name was written here. ...We still have not checked. Quickly-"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""What are you doing?!! I'll go check on Maria and come back! Tell Krauss nii-san and the rest too. After that, follow their instructions!"" "
,"...After saying that much, Rosa finally noticed that something was odd. "
,Her own rank in this family conference was the lowest of the four siblings. 
,"...Why had she been the only one called during an abnormal situation like this, when the other siblings hadn't been? "
,...Even if Maria's name had popped up. 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Could it be...huh? ...What?!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Y-Yes. We tried to contact Krauss-sama, ...but we couldn't find him..."" "
Shannon,"""And Madam was not in her room. ...Judging by the condition of the sheets, she might not have returned to her bed at all last night."" "
,Rosa felt something creepy crawling slowly up her back... 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......D-Did you check inside the chapel?"" "
Kanon,"""No, not yet. We tried, but..."" "
Ronoue Genji,"""...Actually, the lock to the chapel is special, so the master key will not work. There is a single key that can open it, ...but that key is missing from the key box."" "
,She didn't want to get closer to the door with the creepy magic circle if she could. 
,"Rosa readied herself and approached, then tried pushing and pulling the knob. ...All she felt was the resistance of the sturdy lock. "
Kanon,"""We searched to see if there was a window we could enter through, but... I think we'd have to break one of the windows if we wanted to check inside... What do you think?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...There's no way I can give you approval to do something like that. This is Father's precious chapel. ........."" "
,"At that time, the events of the previous day swirled around in the back of Rosa's mind... "
,"......That's right, ...when I met that witch in the rose garden, ...didn't she hand Maria an envelope? "
,"Yeah, there's no mistake, she did hand it over. "
,"When Maria tried to open it, the witch told her not to do it yet, and then she surely said: ""{i:The time to open that will come soon}""... "
,Rosa was sure. ...There could be no mistake. ...The envelope Maria had received was...... 
,"After dashing back to the guesthouse, Rosa approached the cousins' room while hiding her footsteps, softly opened the door, and peered inside... "
,"From the inside, she could hear the healthy snores typical of young people. "
,There were four children. And Maria was there. ...Sleeping soundly. 
,"After breathing a sigh of relief, she entered the room with quiet footsteps. ...She was after Maria's handbag, which was resting on the sofa. "
,Maria always liked carrying her treasures around with her. ...She was probably emulating how her mother always carried her makeup with her. 
,"Of course, she was just imitating her mother, so everything on the inside was junk. "
,"In Maria's case, it was full of small, creepy, occult items, notebooks describing things of that nature, and so on. "
,"...Rosa had never been happy to see her daughter walking around with things like that, which weren't girlish at all. "
,"However, trying to force Maria to stop had resulted in a big fight, so she'd decided to let it be. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........Here. ......This is it......"" "
,A Western envelope with the crest of the gold eagle... 
,"When she took it out of the bag, she realized there was a heavy, vaguely cylindrical object inside. "
,...She could tell by its feel and its weight. ...There was no doubt. This was...a key. 
,"After turning around and checking that Maria was still sound asleep, Rosa tore open the envelope, and the contents spilled out into her palm. "
,...It was a key with an old and intricate design... Rosa gripped that key and dashed out. 
,"...Battler seemed to have noticed that sound, but after grumbling and turning over in his sleep, he started snoring again... "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Genji-san, ...could this key...be the key to the chapel?"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""Where did you... ...Yes, this is the key to the chapel."" "
,Rosa approached the creepy magic circle once again...and put the key in the keyhole. 
,"...There was a strong resistance. After it resisted for a short while, ...it stopped resisting with a clunk. "
,"Then, squeaking with a noise that hurt one's ears, ...it slowly, slowly began to open...... "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Is anyone...there......?!"" "
,"Her voice reverberated throughout the massive room. ...Of course, there was no answer. "
,"The chapel had a high ceiling, and the air was cold. "
,"...And even on this rainy, unsettling day, it felt sacred for some reason... "
,The servants timidly followed after Rosa. 
Kanon,"""...Rosa-sama, look at that."" "
,Kanon noticed it immediately and pointed. 
,...Over there...was the altar. 
,"In the place that would normally have a pastor preaching of God's love, there was a table that shouldn't have been there. "
,"At first, it looked like a dining table. ...There actually were gorgeous plates and utensils placed there, making it look like a child's birthday party or something. "
,"Upon closer inspection, the surrounding area had been decorated with pumpkins and black and orange ribbons. They were probably...Halloween decorations. "
,"And there were people seated at the table. Three people on each side facing each other, seated in chairs. "
,"They could be recognized at a glance. Krauss and his wife, Eva and her husband, and Rudolf and his wife. "
,"But if you wanted to be sure, you'd still have to go even closer and check. "
,...Because they seemed almost like dolls. 
,"Rosa and the rest had opened the door, entered all at once with the sound of many footsteps, and called out, asking if anyone was there. "
,"...And yet, there had been no reaction. ...Even if Rosa and the rest assumed they were being ignored, you'd still expect there to be some kind of reaction. "
,...And there hadn't even been that. 
,"So at first, it felt like someone had set down some dolls that greatly resembled those people... "
,"...By now, it wasn't just Rosa. ...Shannon and Kanon, and even Gohda. "
,...They were all fighting frantically with the creepy emotion that grasped their hearts. 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Nii-san...? ......Nee-san......?"" "
,"As she walked towards the altar, she called out again, but there was still no reaction. "
,"...Yes, ...by now, Rosa was sure of it. "
,"...She was sure these weren't dolls, {i:but the people themselves}...! "
Shannon,"""......This is......"" "
Kanon,"""........."" "
,They grew close enough to see clearly what lay on the table. 
,"It still looked like an adorable banquet, reminiscent of a child's birthday party. "
,"Plates piled up with sweets, cute pitchers with drinks. All kinds of pumpkin-shaped ornaments... "
,"...They were all decorated in a Halloween style, ...and while this probably wasn't the time to be thinking it, Maria would surely have been delighted to see all this. "
,"That was the state of the table they sat in front of, apparently asleep... "
,"It was an eerie scene, ...as though a small, fun-looking Halloween party had been stopped in time... "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...They're all... ...sleeping...? ......?"" "
,"When she approached even closer to them, ...she realized that there were snacks scattered all over the floor. "
,"Candies, cookies, soda and chocolates, ...all with heavily fantasy-themed packaging... "
,They were all scattered across a carpet covered with blackberry and cranberry jam... 
Gohda Toshiro,"""......Wa...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"" "
,Rosa and the rest......finally realized what the situation was... 
,It was...a Halloween party. A banquet for those not of this world...! 
,"Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie were seated in chairs, apparently asleep, ...but all dead. "
,How could you tell that they were dead and not simply sleeping? 
,That was because... they'd been... v- vertically... ...sliced open... ...from their chests to their stomachs......! 
Shannon,"""...K-Krauss-sama......!! Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!"" "
Kanon,""".........How...cruel..."" "
,"The six of them had sat down at a Halloween party, ...before having their stomachs split open, killing them. "
,"Then the jam covering the floor...must be what overflowed from their stomachs once they'd stuffed themselves completely, right...? "
,...No!! 
,The contents of their stomachs had been scattered all over the floor!! And that wasn't all. 
,"Out of their stomachs, ...it was almost as though...almost as though... as though they'd poured out...!! A-As though snacks had overflowed from there!! "
,"Candies and cookies, soda and chocolates... had poured out, stained with blood, and had scattered across the floor!! "
,What could have happened to cause this?! 
,It's almost as though their stomachs were stuffed full to bursting with sweets... and it all poured out when their stomachs split open!! 
,"Rosa remembered a certain shocking meal, a turkey that had been served at her own birthday. "
,"When it had been cut open with a knife, ...out flowed one of her favorite foods. ...But since she hadn't been told what was inside, the deep, deep red ketchup omelet-rice poured out like bloody maggots... pulsing, dripping, slimy, pulpy, squelching!! "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Uerreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechgh!! Eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"" "
,The trauma of her youth was revived. Rosa felt a monster raging inside her stomach as the acid started to rise. 
,"...Unable to hold back, she threw it all up on the floor. "
,Her empty stomach had nothing but stomach acid. 
,The scene in front of her was no fun Halloween party now...! 
,"The three couples were enshrined right there, their stomachs vertically wrenched open, wrenched open with a gyuiiiiiiigubaaa. "
,"So many snacks had been stuffed in there, pulpy, squishy. "
,"Blood and guts and sweets were overflowing onto the floor, ...bloodstained, sticky, sticky, sloppy, pulpy, sweet snacks that made your fingers stick together, gummy, gummy, aaah, but stained with entrails, sloppy, pulpy! What was that I stepped on just now, that didn't feel like a candy or a cookie or soda or a chocolate! "
,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah, I'm scared what did I step on I can't even look at the bottom of my foot!! "
,Aaaaaawaaaakiiiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! 
,...What a...what a gruesome Halloween Party...!!! 
,"From far away, it had looked truly beautiful, fantastical, and fun. But from up close, it was horrible, disgusting, and yet somehow still beautiful...!! "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"" "
,Rosa's wild thoughts tried as best they could to escape her throat with a loud voice that was neither a scream nor a roar... 
Ronoue Genji,"""......Krauss-sama......"" "
Shannon,"""...This is...horrible...just horrible......"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...C-Call an ambulance, ...call the police......!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Th-That's right, the police... Police, police police police police!!"" "
,"If a word so tied to reality hadn't come out of Gohda's mouth, Rosa and the rest would probably have found themselves unable to escape that nightmarish party even now. "
,...But it wasn't because they thought the police might be able to do something. 
,"If they didn't keep yelling about the police, ...it felt as though another seat might be set up at this demon's party and given to them...!! "
,"Their own chests felt like they were expanding unpleasantly from the inside!! Rumbling, churning, ...and it was surely because candy was about to overflow from their stomachs!! "
,"Rosa, once again tortured by a desire to vomit, threw her stomach acid up on the floor. And then she searched. Searched to see if there was any candy in it!! "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Haah, ......haah, ...haah...!! Eeeeh, ...haah... ...A-Anyway!! *cough*, *cough*!!"" "
,"Rosa coughed violently again, forcefully spitting out the stomach acid that had been burning in her throat. "
,"She realized that by now, her whole body had been covered in a filthy sweat... "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""G-Genji-san, Shannon-chan, please contact Father and ask for instructions. Gohda-san, go with Kanon-kun and call the police. ...Then, have Doctor Nanjo come here..."" "
,Why even bring Doctor Nanjo here? It's a bit too late for medical care...! 
,The servants accepted their orders and dashed outside. 
,"After watching them leave, ......Rosa once again stared at her siblings, with whom she'd spent good times and bad, and their partners. Though there could be nothing more tragic than this scene, ...for some reason, she was tempted to describe these fantastical deaths as beautiful...... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...They aren't here. Where'd they go?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""The servant room and the kitchen are both empty. ...What in the world happened?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-uu-uu-!! Mama!! Where's Mama?!! My letter! The letter I got from Beato! Give it back! Give it baaaack!! Waaauau!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Perplexing. ...Battler-kun, are you sure it was Aunt Rosa?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Well, even I was half-asleep, so I'm not too sure, but I get the feeling that, in the early morning, Aunt Rosa came in and fished around in Maria's handbag."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I figured there was probably a tube of toothpaste or something in there."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Why would there be a tube of toothpaste in Maria's handbag? Looks like you were a little more than half-asleep."" "
,"Battler vaguely remembered Rosa entering the cousins' room. Also, when Maria woke up before the rest of them, she'd started rampaging around, saying that someone had opened the envelope she'd been keeping safe. "
,"...Putting two and two together, they figured that Rosa had probably come and opened the envelope. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...A letter from the Golden Witch... I wonder what was inside."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I don't know. ...But that envelope was for Grandfather's personal use, and it had the Ushiromiya family crest on it. ......Whatever was inside it must've had some connection to the family conference."" "
,"She hadn't let anyone touch it, but yesterday, Maria had shown that envelope off to Battler and the rest a whole lot. ...So they remembered it well. "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-uu-uu-!! Mama, give it back! Mama, give it back!! Uu-uu-uu-! Waauuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Well, if you're right, it'd have to be pretty important... ...Why would this mighty witch give something that important to Maria? ...I don't get it."" "
,"Every once in a while, the refreshing morning atmosphere was completely wiped out by the sound of thunder. "
,"...It was only natural. Since the moment they'd woken up, they hadn't met anyone else. "
,"It felt like only they were left, as if the mansion had become an empty husk. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Heeeeey! Anyone there?! Answer me!"" "
,"Jessica called out into the hallway, and eventually, an answer came back. It came from the entrance hall. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""I can hear you. ...Has something happened?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's Doctor Nanjo. ...Thank goodness. It looks like everyone but us hasn't disappeared from this island after all."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Doctor Nanjo, good morning. ...Umm, sorry, but do you know where our parents went...?"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Dear me. ...I only just woke up and came here, you see. I have no way of knowing for sure, but let's see..."" "
,It was only natural. Nanjo was a guest just like the rest of them. He'd come just now to pass the time in the parlor until breakfast. 
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-uu-uu-!! Doctor Nanjo, Mama took it, Mama took my letter!! Give it back, give it back, uu-uu-uu-!!!"" "
,"Maria buried her face in Nanjo's plump stomach, sobbing and crying. "
,...Nanjo could do nothing but be bewildered by this ruckus so early in the morning. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Ah. Someone's running this way. Jessica! Someone's coming!"" "
,"From down the hall, they could sense people running hurriedly. "
,They saw Gohda and Kanon coming towards them. 
,"...Normally, it would be disgraceful for a servant to run inside the mansion. And yet, Battler and the rest didn't even think to question that now. "
,"Maria's sobbing had become so unmanageable, they wanted to ask someone—anyone—where Rosa was. "
,"But the two servants seemed to have bigger things on their minds than Jessica, who was waving at them. "
,"Gohda flew into the servant room, and when Kanon noticed that Nanjo was there, he bowed and approached the doctor at a quick pace before whispering something into his ear. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......What did you say? Rosa-san did?"" "
Kanon,"""Yes. I will guide you, so please accompany me."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Understood..."" "
Kanon,"""This way."" "
,"Without saying anything more than that, Kanon finally noticed Jessica and bowed to her. "
,...But he wasn't calm. 
,"He dashed back down the corridor by which he had come, followed by Nanjo. "
,"By looking at how hurried they were, Battler and the rest realized that yes, something bad really had happened. "
,"They saw Gohda through the door to the servant room, which had been flung open. "
,...He was holding the receiver and violently pressing the hook. 
,"From that, they realized that he was trying to call a hospital or the police. In any event, he was trying to call someone because a serious emergency had occurred. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Let's have a look...!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Yeah...!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Mama, give it back!! Give back my letter!! It's {i:an invitation to the Golden Land}!!"" "
,"They didn't know what, but something was happening. Battler and the rest chased after Kanon and Nanjo... "
,"Aaah, ...and then we realized. Kanon-kun had called Doctor Nanjo, but he hadn't called us. "
,...So we shouldn't have gone with them. 
,I wonder if Alice regretted her excess curiosity when she chased after that rabbit holding a clock... 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""No, you mustn't go in!! You mustn't look!! Jessica-chan! No!!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Hii... ......n- noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Mother, Father!! What...what happened!! Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...What the hell is this... ...This goes way beyond bad taste... Isn't taking someone's life bad enough...? ......What the hell is this!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Going to all the trouble after they died of sitting them on chairs, slicing their stomachs and pulling their entrails out?!! You went to all the trouble of stuffing their stomachs full of sweets?!! Why...why the hell would you do something so fucked up?!! Damn it, damn it! Nice job, you bastard, just great, just great!! Gyyaaaaaaaaggghh!!"" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......It would be best if everyone went outside...! They certainly wouldn't want you all to see them like this..."" "
,"Nanjo told the children to go outside, but no one listened. "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Rosa-san, please tell them. If they keep looking at something like this, ...it will do nothing but harm...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""........."" "
,Rosa regretted her own carelessness. ...She should've realized that the children would eventually come here. 
,...She should've quickly locked up instead of standing around stunned. 
,So the children had come here. They had seen it...! 
,"Surely, at this very moment, they were having a sight burned into their eyes... that was far more grotesque than the shocking meal Rosa had witnessed in her youth... "
,"While she hugged Maria, who seemed to be too shocked to show any emotion at this gruesome scene, Rosa cried for them and their parents. "
,"The four groaning and crying voices, their sadness, ...continued to echo in a place that should have known God's love... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You piece of crap!! Again?! Another one of these murders?!! And this time you made it all elaborate, killing them like it's a total joke!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* I was rather hoping you'd thank me, not cry out in grief."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Thank you?!! Did you say I should thank you, you old bitch?! Damn it, if there's something wrong with your ears, I'll cut them both off so you can hear better!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Why should I have to see that insane way of killing and say ""Oh, thank you very much {f:5:Beatrice}-sama""?! I'll beat your brains out!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In the last game, you lamented the fact that you couldn't see your parents faces after they died, yes? So this time, I left them. Didn't touch them!! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"{i:Take a good look, for without a doubt, your father and the rest have been killed}!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""R...eally, what a nice treat, I'm so fucking happy!! I swore I'd plow your face after I choked the life out of you, but I'll take that back now. I'll rip out your guts instead!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Don't give in to emotion, don't stop thinking. My game has already begun, right? *cackle*cackle*cackle* I decided to leave you neat and tidy corpses this time."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Do you know why? When you denied my existence in the last game, "
{f:5:Beatrice},"you used this line of thinking..."" ""{i:""Their faces were crushed, so the identity of the corpses can't be confirmed.}"" ""{i:Therefore, we can't eliminate the possibility that fake corpses were prepared to create an alibi.}"" ""{i:Unless that possibility's denied, a human culprit theory can still be built!!}"""" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What'd you saaaaaay...?!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*kikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikiki!! So, Battler, is it okay to leave the examination of the corpses to Nanjo? Isn't it traditional in mystery novels for the doctor who performs such examinations to be an accomplice?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Then don't leave the examination to him. Do it yourself. Make completely sure that without a doubt, the six corpses are the six people they're supposed to be, that they really, really are dead, not just pretending!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If you wish to confirm that your Father and Mother have been killed by having their stomachs cut open and their entrails pulled out, you'd better stick your hand inside their stomachs and feel around!! Kuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, ki-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I won't cry!!! Damn it, damn it, ...I won't cry...!!"" "
,Battler suddenly yelled. 
,"His tears were still dripping down, but as though scolding himself for being a sissy, he slapped his face hard several times with both hands. "
,"Even so, the tears still wouldn't stop. ...However, he felt a hot blaze in both his eyes. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Whoever's responsible for this piece of work, I'll make them pay back their debt completely!! So this isn't the time to cry, gotta think about what to do!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Aaaah, it's useless, it's all useless!! If you've got enough time to cry, then think! This is no time to let yourself cry!!"" "
,"Rather than genuine anger, maybe it was more of an evasive anger to blot out his sadness. "
,"...However, it gave a little courage to George and Jessica, who'd been crushed by the sadness. "
Ushiromiya George,"""...That's right. ...Even if we cry, ...it won't change the reality... of what has happened."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Damn it, ...damn it damn it damn it, ...damn it damn it damn it!! Then what should we do?! What should I do...for Mom and Dad's sakes?!!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Rosa-sama... I have returned..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Gohda-san, what happened with the police? What did they say to do? Did they say when they think they'll be able to get here?"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""...As to that, ...it seems the phones have broken down... I also tried the emergency wireless, but...umm, maybe it's the weather, but that isn't working either..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""What did you say...?! So, we can't contact the police?!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It's that person! They did something to the phone line, made it so we can't reach the cops!!"" "
,"When she heard that the phones had broken down, Jessica immediately decided that it was the work of that mysterious guest. "
,"Her eyes were bright-red after so much crying, and they began to grow even redder with rage. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Gah, there's no need to talk about it, right?! I understand everything, that's right, I get it! Who killed Dad and Mom?!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It's obviously her!! It's gotta be that witch or whatever who came yesterday!!! I'll grab her by the collar!! Damn it damn it damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Jessica-chan...! Wait! Gohda-san, Kanon-kun, go!"" "
Kanon,"""Y-Yes Ma'am...!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Milady, wait...!"" "
,"Covering her uncontrollable sadness with anger, Jessica ran outside, torn apart by emotion. "
,"...Thinking about it hastily, maybe the mystery guest who'd arrived yesterday, {f:5:Beatrice}, was suspicious. However, in that instant, there was absolutely no proof that she was the culprit. "
,"...At this moment, she's just another guest, no more, no less. "
,"So Rosa, making an adult decision, was forced to stop Jessica in her rash rampage. Gohda and Kanon picked up on this immediately and chased after her. "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Could the guest that no one invited, {f:5:Beatrice}, be the culprit...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I understand how Jessica feels. ...I wish I could think that too. It doesn't matter who, I want someone to be the culprit so I can bash them right in the face!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"...But before that, we need a clear understanding of what's going on. ...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}? I haven't even seen her face!!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. If you're looking for her face, it decorates the big portrait in the mansion. You still don't remember after looking at it for so long? Kihihihihihi."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Come on, Maria. ...What's so funny in a situation like this?!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""{f:5:Beatrice} is a witch. And the ceremony to open the door to the Golden Land has finally begun. Those six people are sacrifices. ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi! "
Ushiromiya Maria,"Come, let us begin the witch's banquet. Tonight is Halloween, so now the witches will gather to celebrate. Ki-hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Maria, how many times have I told you to stop laughing in that creepy voice!"" "
,The crisp sound of Rosa slapping Maria's cheek echoed through the high-ceilinged chapel... 
,"Ever since it started raining yesterday... No, ...ever since the island was swallowed by the typhoon, I've felt as though something...was wrong. "
,"It was bright and sunny when I arrived on Rokkenjima, but since I'd gotten up early and was sleepy, I took a nap. "
,"...When I woke up, it had already started raining. "
,And ever since that time... 
,"Suddenly, a mysterious visitor calling herself the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} arrived, and it felt like I was sinking bit by bit into a bizarre world. "
,"What the heck happened while I was napping? Am I supposed to believe this island was sealed off inside a different world, where common sense doesn't apply...?! "
,"Who is this person called {f:5:Beatrice}? Is some unknown person trying to involve themselves with the inheritance problem, just like our parents were freaking out about at dinner last night? "
,"...Or is the culprit this witch from the Legend of the Gold, just like Maria said?! "
,"Even if we set Jessica's temper aside, given the circumstances, it's probably safe to say that this visitor person is the most suspicious. "
,"But we mustn't make up our minds based on that alone. Aaah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless...!! "
,"I smacked my face with both hands again, cooling off my brains before they overloaded. Even though it might've been a wasted effort... "
Ushiromiya George,"""...This......is one of Grandfather's envelopes."" "
,"On a tray piled up with sweets that decorated the table, George-aniki found a Western envelope that had the Ushiromiya family crest done on it in gold leaf. "
,"And, it was unopened. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Which means...it's probably meant for us, right? If it was something Dad and the others read, it should be open."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...It seems your reasoning is correct. ...It's written right here. Someone wrote ""to those who remain""."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Is that...a letter the culprit left...?! Wh-What's inside...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aniki, let's open it...!"" "
,"After nodding silently, George-aniki broke the seal. ...A folded letter came out. "
Ushiromiya George,"""......I'll read it. ......Welcome to Rokkenjima, members of the Ushiromiya family. I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family employed by Kinzo-sama himself..."" "
,That letter really was a joke. 
,"This {f:5:Beatrice}, who called herself the family alchemist, had announced that she was collecting the gold she'd lent Grandfather, along with interest. "
,And that interest...was everything Grandfather had created. 
,"Since this tragedy was right before our eyes as this paragraph was being read aloud, it clearly wasn't referring just to the wealth that Grandfather had built up. "
,"...It was literal. Everything that Grandfather had created... ...In other words, ...all of Grandfather's descendants were included in the interest! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You bastard!! What a screwed up contract! Lives as interest for gold, you say?! That's almost like a contract with the devil, isn't it?! You think that makes you look more like a witch?! Ha, don't make me laugh!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Special clause. ......However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, {f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Hmm... ...Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...In other words, it's something like this. If these murders represent her collecting interest, then she's telling us to try and find the gold she gave Grandfather if we want her to stop... And, she's also saying that the secret pointing to the gold is hidden in the portrait epitaph."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So, basically, ...this is a letter of challenge from the witch? She's telling us to try and solve the code that points to the hidden gold, if we can?! And if we can't, she'll keep collecting the interest as planned?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'll beat you to death, bring it on!!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...B-Battler-kun! Look, ...look!!!"" "
,"The table was covered with sweets, ...so even though those things were right out in the open, we just assumed they were sweets too. "
,"...I mean, come on, you see them a lot, right? "
,"...You know, those boxes of chocolate shaped like gold ingots...! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Th-This is no box of candy... It's the real thing...! This is a real gold bar...!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...It's inscribed with the crest of the One-Winged Eagle... ...I heard Mother talking about this earlier. ...This is a gold bar from Grandfather's Legend of the Gold...!!"" "
,Gold ingots weighing a full 10 kilograms...a whole three of them...were piled up in the very center of the table! It was where a cake would be placed if it was a birthday party. 
,"...In other words, this was without a doubt the birthday cake of the party known as the family conference! "
Ushiromiya George,"""If these are really four‐nines‐purity ingots... ...nn, *gulp*. They, they're worth about 60 million yen!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You stupid biiiiiitch!! That's way too cheap!!! Six of our parents have been killed, and the gold you throw our way for it is a measly 60 million yen?! Don't take us for fools, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. ...So, it has begun, {f:5:Beatrice}. ...It's not like anyone can solve this riddle anyway. So Beato will definitely win."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Quickly, open the door to the Golden Land. And take me with you. ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"" "
