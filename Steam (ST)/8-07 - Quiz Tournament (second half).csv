Speaker,Steam (ST)
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Who should we get a puzzle from next?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What about those two?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun? Sure, it looks like they'll put up a good fight."" "
Shannon,"""Do you need something, Eva-sama and Ange-sama?"" "
Kanon,"""...Don't be stupid, Nee-san. They're asking us for puzzles."" "
Shannon,"""Ah, m-my apologies!"" "
,Shannon was as absentminded as ever. 
,"However, Kanon looked extremely calm, and would probably have a well-polished puzzle ready. "
Shannon,"""Ummm, uhhhhh......"" "
Kanon,"""...*sigh*. Okay, I'll go first. Use that time to think up a puzzle, Nee-san."" "
Shannon,"""O-Okay. Sorry..."" "
Kanon,"""So, if I'm buying time for Nee-san to think up a puzzle, I'll have to make one tricky enough to keep you stumped for a while."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Heheheheh, you've got guts, kid. Let's have it, shall we? Show us the hardest one you've got!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Don't provoke him! I want a easy one!"" "
Kanon,"""Now that I have Eva-sama's permission, allow me to present an insanely difficult puzzle."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Leave this to me. I'll solve it!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The number of coins are really different, and kind of weird."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wait a second, Kanon-kun! What are you thinking?! There's no way she'll be able to get this one, right?!"" "
Kanon,"""This is just to buy time until Nee-san can think up a question, so forgive me."" "
Shannon,"""Th-Thank you...! I've thought of a question...!"" "
Kanon,"""...Understood. Now then, Eva-sama and Ange-sama, I'll give you a hint. ......Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79. That's the hint."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's just what you said in the question...! That's not a hint!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Copper is 29? Silver is 47?? ......Oh, so that's it!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? You got it?! I get it too! Platinum is better than gold, so the prize must be more than 79 gold coins!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's wrong. With these rules, the platinum prize is probably worth less than the gold prize. Isn't that right?"" "
Kanon,"""...It is as you say. It seems you've already found the answer."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This puzzle is impossible for Ange-chan. You'd need to have gone to middle school at the very least. I'll answer! Is that all right, Ange-chan?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""S-Sure. I'll leave it to you...!"" "
Kanon,"""Incorrect."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Aaaaaaaahhh, sorry, I messed up!! If only I'd taken science class more seriously!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What do you mean? I don't get it."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The number of gold coins is the atomic number for each element. Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79. I can't remember what number platinum was...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't have a clue what you're talking about."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You! What kind of problem do you think you're giving Ange-chan?! Can't you put a little more thought into your puzzles?!"" "
Kanon,"""You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...That's right. You said it yourself. That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nnggggggggggghhhh...!! ...S-Sorry, Ange-chan..."" "
,"Aunt Eva clenched her hands together, grimacing. "
,"It was just too hard, and I didn't have a clue... "
Kanon,"""......Correct."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Awesome, Aunt Eva! Why?! Why is it 78 coins?! If platinum is better than gold, then why does gold get more coins?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The number of coins you get is always the same as the atomic number of the prize. Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79. And, by the way, platinum is 78. So, the platinum prize gets you 78 gold coins."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...A-Aunt Eva, you're incredible!!"" "
,"Dad once told me that Aunt Eva was an enthusiastic studier, and really, really smart even back when she was in school. "
,"Even George onii-chan, her son, is smart, so Aunt Eva must really be incredible. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Still, that was a pretty nasty riddle to choose. You should have at least given one that Ange could understand."" "
Kanon,"""You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...That's right. You said it yourself. That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nnggggggggggghhhh...!! I-Is it my fault? Sorry, Ange-chan... But look, we got a medal, so please forgive me."" "
,We got another medal. Just how many have we gotten so far? But we still have a lot left to get. Next up is Shannon. 
Shannon,"""Mine isn't that hard, so you can relax."" "
Kanon,"""After all, you managed to think it up."" "
Shannon,"""Y-You're making fun of me...! Then do you want to have a go at it too, Kanon-kun?"" "
Kanon,"""Bring it on."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It sounds like you'll be able to understand it this time, Ange-chan. I'll stick to giving hints again."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay, I'll do my best. I'll solve it. Another medal for me."" "
Shannon,"""Let's go then. Listen carefully..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't get it. What do the letters mean...?"" "
Kanon,"""...Could it be the first letter of each word?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's what I thought at first. White chocolate starts with ""W"", pepper jack starts with ""P"", and anchovy starts with ""A"". But then, how do you explain lemonade being ""O""?"" "
Shannon,"""Heheheheheheheh. Do you get it?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Don't you have any more hints for me?"" "
Shannon,"""I do. I'll teach you the letters for some other foods. First, walnut cake is ""W"". Albacore tuna is an ""A"". For ""P"", how about picante potatoes? Iced green tea can be an ""I"". Heheheheheheheh......"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It really does sound like the first letter is the key... But then how do you explain black coffee being ""I""......?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I love ""W"" foods. Cream cakes are ""W"", right?"" "
Shannon,"""That's right."" "
Kanon,"""So, it isn't the first letter after all..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What's going on? What is this ""W"" group? White chocolate and walnut cake, right? Are these desserts? Treats? ""A"" is anchovy pizza and albacore tuna? ""P"" is picante potatoes and piri piri chicken curry, and ""I"" is coffee and green tea? Just what are these groups??"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I sort of get it, but I sort of don't. ......It's a little annoying."" "
Shannon,"""One last hint. Have you ever had lemonade to drink?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I have. I thought it was just going to be sweet, so I was really surprised. I'll never drink it again."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Ah, ...I've got it! Ange-chan, thank you. Thanks to you, I've probably figured it out!"" "
Shannon,"""Giving up? What about you, Kanon-kun?"" "
Kanon,"""...I don't get it. ...I think I almost do, but..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. I almost know what all the groups mean, but I can't figure out that last step."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's...tastes, right?"" "
Shannon,"""Yes, that's right. Have you figured it out now, Ange-sama and Kanon-kun?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't get it! What is it, Aunt Eva? Tell me!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Everything in the ""W"" group is sweet, right? So, what about the ""A"" group? The ""P"" group?"" "
Kanon,""".........I see, so that's what it was... Not bad, coming from you, Nee‐san..."" "
Shannon,"""Why don't you try saying ""sorry for making fun of you""? If you don't, I'll make all your meals ""O"" and ""I""."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""‘O’ is one thing, but eating ""I"" all the time would be awful."" "
,"In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of ""I"" cooking and was forced to apologize to Shannon. "
,Ange was still confused. 
,No point thinking about it anymore. 
,I've got to pull myself together and take a shot at the next one. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""See, Ange-chan? Think about the tastes of all these foods! How does white chocolate taste?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Sweet."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And what about anchovy pizza?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Salty."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Then how about piri piri chicken curry? And black coffee?!"" "
Kanon,"""......I see, so that's what it is......"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Piri piri is spicy. Coffee is bitter. ......So what is it? Do the letters match the tastes?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right! The second letter of ""sweet"" is ""W"". The second letter of ""salty"" is ""A"", ""spicy"" is ""P"", and ""bitter"" is ""I""! So, what does lemonade taste like?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Sour!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Exactly! And the second letter of ""sour"" is... ""O""! So the answer for lemonade is ""O""!"" "
Shannon,"""Nice job. You got it right, Eva-sama and Ange-sama."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Aunt Eva, you're so awesome!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We had to work together to solve that one. It's a team effort."" "
Shannon,"""And here is my medal. Please take it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""All right, I got another medal! Thanks!"" "
Shannon,"""You didn't get it, did you, Kanon-kun? I'll bet it was hard."" "
Kanon,"""...Not bad, coming from you, Nee-san..."" "
Shannon,"""Why don't you try saying ""Sorry for making fun of you""? If you don't, I'll make all your meals ""O"" and ""I""."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""""O"" is one thing, but eating ""I"" all the time would be awful."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I wanna eat ""W"" all the time!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Careful, you'll get cavities. But if you ever come to my house to play, I'd be more than willing to share."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yay!! I love you, Aunt Eva!!"" "
,"In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of ""I"" cooking and was forced to apologize to Shannon... "
Shannon,"""That's all for our puzzles. Did you enjoy them...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Thanks!"" "
Kanon,"""It seems the others still have some brain-twisters waiting for you. Please be careful."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Good point. Everyone left looks like they'll be a challenge."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""But we'll win! We can do it if we work together...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. Let's combine our wits and move on!"" "
Shannon,"""Goodbye. And good luck."" "
,Shannon and Kanon returned to the kitchen with the serving cart. 
,"The dining hall was filled with such an exciting and fun atmosphere, but out here in the corridor, one was reminded of the fierce winds and the rain. "
,"But, they were satisfied with this. "
,The whole point of this noisy farewell party was to forget the loneliness of the rain for just a little bit. 
Shannon,"""...So, we've reached the end of this long game..."" "
Kanon,"""I feel relieved. ...Finally, we won't have to be toys for anyone else. ...I'd like to be quietly forgotten, to get covered with dust and vanish."" "
Shannon,"""You're wrong. We aren't going to vanish like that."" "
Kanon,"""............"" "
Shannon,"""In the world locked inside the cat box, our future will continue, unknown to anyone."" "
Kanon,"""...You're right. ...Sorry. That's a world that even we can't know about, ...so I forgot."" "
Shannon,"""Just what kind of future will we make for ourselves in the cat box world?"" "
Kanon,"""I don't know. That's why it's called a cat box."" "
Shannon,"""......Good point."" "
Kanon,"""Don't you have any regrets, Nee-san? ...About George-sama, for instance?"" "
Shannon,"""........."" "
Kanon,"""Receiving that ring is all you can do for George-sama. As for marriage, living together, and all the rest..."" "
Shannon,"""Our future inside the cat box is what will make all that come true, isn't it? ...I'm not the only one. It's the same for you, right? What about a future for you and Milady Jessica?"" "
Kanon,"""...I'm..."" "
Shannon,"""I could break off my engagement with George-sama, then leave the island and disappear. That future is also possible for me. In that world, you wouldn't have to hesitate for my sake. ...You could enjoy your youth to the fullest with Milady."" "
Kanon,"""...If you gave up on your engagement with George-sama, that sort of world might be possible."" "
Shannon,"""So, ...since it's a cat box, the world where I spend my life with George-sama and the world where you spend your life with Milady can both exist at the same time."" "
Kanon,"""...It's a world where any contradicting dreams can exist at once."" "
Shannon,"""That's the world we'll be put away in as pieces. ...So, there's no need to be lonely, no need to be sad. ...Even though the ""me"" here right now can only observe the part where I accept George-sama's ring."" "
,"The other ""me"" who lives in the cat box, in a world I cannot witness, will surely build a happy life in the future... "
,"The cat box is such a strange thing, a place where any pieces and toys and dreams can be kept. "
,It's no cage sealing us in. 
,"On the contrary, being inside the cat box means being free from everything in countless worlds... "
Kanon,"""A world where we're freed from everything, and yet where all of our wishes come true. ...However, the ""me"" in that world won't be the ""me"" here and now. ...That's a bit depressing."" "
Shannon,"""...Hey, Kanon-kun."" "
Kanon,"""Yes...?"" "
Shannon,"""Let's do it."" "
Kanon,"""...Do what?"" "
Shannon,"""Let's have a duel."" "
Kanon,"""......Are you sure?"" "
Shannon,"""We both wish we'd settled this much sooner. And yet, we've put it off until the last moment, just before the game is going to end."" "
Kanon,"""...Sure. ...The game is nearly over anyway. Now, at the very end, ...it's time for us to settle things by ourselves."" "
Shannon,"""That way, we'll be able to see our future before we're put away in the cat box."" "
Kanon,"""...Sure. Let's do it. ...How will we decide it? A coin? Or with pistols again...?"" "
Shannon,"""Ummm, ...in that case, why don't we have our own quiz tournament?"" "
Kanon,"""...Huh? ...You're really getting into this."" "
Shannon,"""Okay, then... First question-"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihhihihihihihihi! I'm gonna give Ange a reeeeally hard one! I'll trick her with my extra-hard puzzle and make sure she neeever gets my medal!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'll solve it. I'll definitely solve it...!"" "
,"As soon as Maria and Ange crossed gazes, they started fighting. "
,"The two girls so close in age were really good friends, but they also fought a lot. "
,Especially when they were opponents in a game. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Maria-chan probably knows tons of different quizzes. This should be interesting. Let's have it."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihhihihihi, not now. I'm the star, so I'll go after Mama!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Really? You're sure it's okay for me to go first?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Yeah!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Then let's begin. Ready? Heheheheheh."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Hmmmm... I guess you don't need a hint for this one."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""*giggle* You're right. I made it for Ange-chan. It's probably a bit too easy for you, Nee-san."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""An hour is 60 minutes, and it takes 8 minutes for each round trip..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Good luck. I know you can solve it. I won't give you a hint this time."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? Why is that wrong...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Heheh, sorry about that. I guess that was a little mean."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The key to the puzzle is the part about how many can she ""carry out""."" "
,...Oh. Looks like I made a pretty simple mistake. 
,"I've been taking on so many tricky riddles, I've gotten a bit too tense. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That's all for my puzzle. Now, for the one you've been waiting for. Good luck with Maria's puzzle!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""8 ingots...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Heheh, are you sure? It takes eight minutes to carry each ingot to the surface, right? 8x8 is more than 60."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's right. But the question was ""How many can she carry out of the room?"" Rosa only has to take one step out of the room to ""carry it out""."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nice going, Ange-chan...! All those puzzles have really warmed you up good."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That's right. To do 7 trips, you need 8X7=56 minutes. There are only 4 minutes left. However, you can make it back to the underground room in 3 minutes, then ""carry out"" the eighth ingot in the last minute."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihihihihihi... Not bad, Ange! Nice one, uu-."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm not gonna lose to you, Maria onee-chan!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Congratulations. Here's my medal. Now you can try the puzzle Maria picked out just for you."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""So, it's finally my turn. Kihihihihi, you took so long on Mama's easy puzzle that I got a little worried. There's no way you'll ever solve this one!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I've got Aunt Eva with me, and we'll solve it together!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihihihihi, impossible, impossible, impossible! Even Aunt Eva can't solve this one! Wolves and Sheep puzzles are incredibly hard...!"" "
,"From her handbag, Maria pulled out a ""Wolves and Sheep Puzzle Book"" that was worn-out, well-used, and had a majestic feel to it, like a grimoire. "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""You know what a Wolves and Sheep puzzle is, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I know. You show me those all the time."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""They're puzzles about using a boat to take everyone from one shore of a river to another."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""They usually have a few bizarre rules. When there's wolves and sheep, you can't let the number of wolves on either shore get bigger than the number of sheep, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Yeah, that's right! Send a boat back and forth, moving everyone to the other side while making sure that there are never more wolves than sheep...!! But the ones with just wolves and sheep are the simplest, easiest, plainest beginner's basic practice puzzles...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""When you get to the higher levels, you have many things other than wolves and sheep. It's pretty clever."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Should we write this down on a piece of paper?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Good idea. That'll definitely make it easier for you to sort out your thoughts."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*sigh* ...Sounds like this puzzle will be a handful."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""There's no way you're getting my medal, Ange! Kihihihihihihi!!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I won't lose. I'm not gonna lose!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""W-Wait a second... Who ever heard of a puzzle with such complicated rules?!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Did you only know about the ones with wolves and sheep? It's got lots of complicated puzzles that you've got to deal with in different ways! See? You don't get it either, right, Ange?! Kihihihihihi!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Please, give me a hint!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""You have to organize your thoughts carefully. Only the three humans can row the boat. Then, you have to memorize all the things to look out for. When the peasant is away, you can't leave his wife with the shepherd. When both the peasant and his wife are away, you can't leave the shepherd with the meat. When the shepherd is away, you can't leave the sheep with the veggies. You also need someone to watch the cow, but any of the humans can do that. Still, I guess the meat is the real key to the whole thing."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Ah, I see. You can't put it on the boat again once you take it off, but that doesn't mean you can only take it across once."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""That's right. The veggies really can make only one trip, so once you've sent them across, you can't get them back. But as long as you don't take the meat off the boat, you can take it back and forth as much as you want."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...It's so complicated. Even after thinking about it, I don't get it at all..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We'll have to write it down and sort out our ideas. Do you want a pen and paper too, Ange-chan?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Impossible, impossible! You'll never solve it! If only you'd just give up. Thinking is a waste of time for the incompetent! Kihihihihihihihihi...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Can this really be solved? Don't tell me there's actually some contradiction that makes it unsolvable..."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uuu---? Who knows? Kiiihihihihihihi!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihihihihihi!! Wrong! You can't even do this one?! You suck, Ange, kihihihihihihihihihi, ouch!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Maria! Show some manners!"" "
,"I thought so hard before getting that answer, but Maria onee-chan just burst out laughing. "
,"The laughter broke off when Aunt Rosa hit her, but then she was grinning again. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I don't get it at all. What was the difficulty level for this one...?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Just about 20 picarats, I guess? Lots of the puzzles in this book are much, much harder!"" "
,"I don't know what a pica-thing is, but apparently, even this puzzle doesn't count as a hard one for Maria onee-chan... "
,I hung my head dejectedly. 
,Maria onee-chan kept on laughing until Aunt Rosa smacked her again. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This really is a nasty problem. Can it really be solved? Is there some trick to it, like throwing things into the river without using the boat, or making the cow eat the vegetables so that they can be carried as one passenger...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Well, who knows? If that's as far as you can go, maybe you should give up, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""This one's really hard! Even Mama couldn't solve it! But I solved it on my first try!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""So, do you get it? How many trips does it take to get every person across?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This isn't a cheap trick or a riddle, right? There's no way you can solve this straightforwardly, right?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""No, that's not true. I'm sure you'll get it Nee-san, smart as you are. How many trips does it take to get every person across?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I've got it. Three trips."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Huh? Three?! How...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's easy. The peasant and his wife get on the boat, then the wife gets dropped off on the other side in the first move. Then, the peasant takes the boat back across in the second move. Then, he crosses with the shepherd in the third move."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But what about the cow and the sheep?! What about the meat and the vegetables?!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""But Aunt Eva, it said to take every person across, right? Those other things aren't people."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Huh? Ah......"" "
,"As Aunt Eva's mouth flopped open, Aunt Rosa started applauding. After clicking her tongue, Maria onee-chan joined in. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That's right. The question just asks how many moves it would take to move each person across. The animals and luggage never had anything to do with it."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""They only got it because you kept saying ""every person"" over and over again, Mama. Uu!"" "
,"Aunt Rosa had probably said it so much as a sort of hint. Without that, even I wouldn't have figured it out. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Come on. I was totally taken in. That was a mean question!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Go on, Maria. Give Ange-chan her medal."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-uu-uu-..."" "
,"Whining like a unhappy dog, she reluctantly handed the medal over. "
,I grabbed it and started jumping around like a happy dog. 
,"As Maria onee-chan smiled at me from behind, ...her face was bright, just like a big sister's. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That's the end of our riddles. Let's play again sometime, okay?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Next time, I'll have a really nasty puzzle that's even harder...! One so hard that even I couldn't solve it!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No way! I'm not playing with Maria onee-chan anymore...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*giggle* Look, Ange-chan. Your parents are waving at you, so let's go. See you later, Rosa."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Sure. Later, Ange-chan. There aren't too many people left with puzzles for you. Keep it up until the end. And make sure you keep cheering her on, Nee-san."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Of course. We got all these medals by working together, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah!"" "
,We dashed away. 
,Dad and Mom are waving at me from over there. 
,I'm sure they've thought up some mean problems. 
,"Still, they have to be easier than Maria onee-chan's...! "
,I hate Maria onee-chan! She's such a meanie! 
Sakutarou,"""Uryu-. You bullied her too much with that puzzle..."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Well, I wanted to play with Ange a lot. If it was an easy one, she'd solve it right away, right?"" "
Sakutarou,"""You really love Ange, don't you?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I hate her. She made fun of you and called you a stuffed animal."" "
,"Maria pouted as she said this, but her expression didn't match her words at all. "
Sakutarou,"""I hope Ange finds happiness."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I'm sure she will. After all, look at all the people here wishing for her happiness. And now, Battler is the Game Master, and he's set up this final game just for Ange. ...After all this, there's no way she won't be happy."" "
Sakutarou,"""...Still, even though anyone can make happiness appear, you can only ever grasp it for yourself."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""That's right. That kid is really bad at finding Fragments of happiness. Even though we tried to teach her how, she's been covering her ears for 12 full years. ...This game might be much harder for Ange than Battler thinks."" "
Sakutarou,"""...I'm sure Ange will find happiness."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Yeah. ...If she really does enjoy herself at this party, that itself might be the greatest lesson we can teach her now."" "
,"Ange is the girl who doesn't believe and says that everything is a trick, no matter what magic is shown to her... "
,"12 years in the future, that girl will become the last person to inherit {f:5:Beatrice}'s name. "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""At one point in time, that kid understood my white magic."" "
Sakutarou,"""Yeah. And she understood me too."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""She even summoned all of the Seven Sisters and understood magic itself. ...And yet, she still can't use magic on herself."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Let us believe. Just as Battler did once, in the past."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...Beato."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It is easy to cast magic on others. And believing in other people's magic is not so difficult. The hardest thing is casting magic on yourself."" "
Sakutarou,"""Is that...something Ange can do...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""She can. Even Battler managed to understand magic. Of course his little sister will be able to do the same."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""You're right. ...There are some kinds of magic that we can only see when we're kids. ...And there are some that only adults can understand. Right now, Ange is between the two of those."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""She's lost the magic of children, but she has yet to understand the magic of adults. It's the most painful period of one's life."" "
Sakutarou,"""It's so sad...that she didn't have anyone close to her at a time like that..."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""That's not true. We're always by that kid's side. She just doesn't believe it."" "
,"Ange, please, realize that quickly. "
,"There are so many people smiling at you from behind, watching over you. "
,"If you just turn around, we'll be able to smile so much more...and talk to you so much more. "
,"......You're {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, the final witch of Mariage Sorcière. "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Even if you aren't able to do the right thing in the end, ...I pray that you can at least enjoy yourself tonight..."" "
,"Have fun, Ange. "
,So long. 
,"The time we spent together feels so long, yet so short. Even so, for me, those memories are eternal... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""How's it going, Ange? Did you get a ton of medals?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I wonder how many it is now!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Me too. Let's count them later, okay?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It seems you've been given quite a few puzzles already."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Once I get your puzzles, I think only the cousins are left."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Is that so, huh? All right. Time to take a shot at Mom and Dad's puzzles! I'll warn you, they're gonna be hard!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Everyone says the same thing, but we just keep on solving them!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah! We'll get those medals together!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle* That's the spirit. Okay, I guess I'll go first."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ah, it's a classic liar puzzle. Those are the ones I'm best at."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Don't you mean lying is what you're best at?"" "
,Wow. I didn't think Dad's ears could stretch that far. 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Only one of them is speaking the truth. And both of the others are lying. So, if you find an answer where two of them are telling the truth, it's wrong."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...I don't really get it. I want some more hints."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's all for my hint. If you want more, try talking to Aunt Eva."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Aunt Eva!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Rika is the key. Rika says that Miyoko is a liar. So, if Miyoko is speaking the truth, then Rika is a liar, and if Miyoko is lying, then Rika is speaking the truth. ...In other words, since that pair contradicts each other, we know that one of them is lying and one is telling the truth."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's Eva nee-san for you. Exactly. In liar games like this one, when you see a pair that contradicts each other, you know that one of them must be telling the truth. Neither of them is Satoko, so she's already confirmed as a liar. ...*giggle* Looks like the answer's already popped up."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Ummm, ......???"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Too bad, but that's not it."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I guess Ange's still too little for that one."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Am not! I just made a little mistake! I'll get it right next time. So, one more...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Aw, and you were so close too..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Then you can make up for it with my puzzle. Okay, let's try another one of those liar games. Will you be able to get it this time?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Rika!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right! Nice job, Ange-chan! Hard to imagine such a smart girl being related to that dolt of a father!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Yeah, sorry for being a dolt. Nice going, Ange! Did you think of all the combinations?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. If Miyoko is the oldest, then what Satoko says is true. Only the oldest person is supposed to tell the truth, so that doesn't make sense."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's right. Then what if Satoko is the oldest?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""If she is, then Rika would be telling the truth when she says Miyoko is a liar, which doesn't work. So, Rika has to be the oldest."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Good job. Here's my medal for you. Congrats."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thank you, Mom!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Rudolf is up next. I wonder what sort of puzzle he has for us."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Well, guess I'll do a liar puzzle too. Let's crank it up a notch this time..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""They're all wearing masks, ...and except for Miyoko, we can't tell if they're lying or telling the truth. ...This one's hard."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""No, it isn't. I've already figured it out. This is even easier than the one your mom gave a second ago."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Why?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You can't trust the two who aren't Miyoko, so you first need to figure out who Miyoko is. Miyoko doesn't lie, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Miyoko doesn't lie."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""So, start off by figuring out who Miyoko is, then read through the puzzle again. I'm sure you'll see it at once."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Just think about who Miyoko is... Okay, I've got it."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You really do whatever Eva nee-san tells you."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Aunt Eva is nice and smart, and I like her. So I do what she tells me!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Next time we try to feed Ange eggplant and bell peppers, we'll need to ask her to lend a hand."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle*giggle*..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Toooo bad!! That's wrong."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh?! I got it wrong? I got it wrong?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Later on, try thinking it over with Aunt Eva. I'm sure you'll figure it out soon."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Think about it. Miyoko speaks the truth, right? So, is it possible for someone to be Miyoko if they say the person next to them is Miyoko?"" "
,Miyoko speaks the truth. 
,"So, she should say that she is Miyoko. She wouldn't say that someone else was Miyoko. "
,"...Once you realize that, it's probably easy to figure out who Miyoko is. "
,"I've figured out the knack of it, but too late. Too bad... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I know who Miyoko is. She's on the left. After all, the girls in the middle and on the right both say that someone else is Miyoko. If they were Miyoko, they couldn't lie and say that someone else was Miyoko."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. Miyoko is supposed to be honest. So, once someone says that someone else is Miyoko, they can't be her."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""So, since the middle one and the right one aren't Miyoko, the left one automatically is. And since Miyoko speaks the truth, then it's also true that the kid on the right is Satoko."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Which means that the only kid left, the one in the middle, is Rika. Perfect!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You solved it like it was nothing! Ange, you really are smart like your Mom!"" "
,Dad rubbed my cheek and hugged me. 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""That's all for our puzzles."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Listen up, Ange. Life will lead you through countless puzzles. ...Aunt Eva is here to help you now, so it's okay to rely on her. However, you'll have to solve most problems in life by yourself. When that happens, you must remember the advice you've gotten from those who have helped you in the past."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay. I get it."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Eva nee-san, take care of Ange."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes, of course."" "
,"Even though the cousins were the only ones who hadn't given us puzzles, Mom spoke as though I was leaving on a long, long trip. ...Weird. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Let's go, Ange-chan. The game will be over soon."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I wonder what Grandpa will give us for getting all these medals...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Me too. Still, we've already gotten many things that are far more wonderful than that prize."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What do you mean...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We've all had a lot of fun talking to you like this, Ange-chan."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......? I don't get it. You're weird."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I'm sorry. Let's go then. Now, all that's left are the cousins and {f:5:Beatrice}, I guess."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""What is it? Why did you tell me to come over here? ......Is it something to do with Ange?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""No, that's not it. ............"" "
,Rudolf put a cigarette in his mouth and toyed with his lighter. 
,"...Though he should have done this easily, he somehow managed to mess up several times. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I...wanted to take this to my grave. ...No, to hide it away in a cat box. If I just kept my mouth shut until tomorrow night, I'd be able to do that. It'd be easy."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I...might be killed tonight. ...That's what I wanted to talk about."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I knew it. I knew you were hiding something."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Did you? Guess I still need more practice."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......If it isn't about Ange, then who is it about? You aren't talking about Asumu-san, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It's about Battler."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...It comes to the same thing. I've tried to behave as an adult towards Battler-kun, right? Even though he's Asumu's son, I've tried to treat him the same as Ange. I do think of him as a child in our family, so don't worry."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""He's not just a kid in our family. He's my kid and yours."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I'm sorry, but you'll have to let me draw the line there."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You don't get it. He's my kid...and yours."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......What?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You didn't have a stillbirth. Asumu did. ...Back then, when I was double-timing the two of you, I got myself stuck and couldn't find a way out..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You don't...mean..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Asumu and I were married. You and I were cheating. Then, Asumu had a stillbirth, and you gave birth. ...My head was a mess with it all."" "
,The sin Rudolf committed when his mind was at its most chaotic... ...was to switch the two babies. 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I was even better off financially back then. I was young, and I didn't give a damn about what lengths I went to. ...I threatened the hospital while slapping them with money...and switched your kid with Asumu's."" "
,"If Kyrie had a child, Rudolf would have to maintain two households. "
,"However, if Kyrie had a stillbirth and the child who survived was Asumu's, that would settle everything. "
,...The stillbirth might even have given him a chance to break off his relationship with Kyrie. 
,"...It was a grave sin, one that simply couldn't be forgiven as an act of youthful enthusiasm and immaturity. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......That's why...I should be apologizing to all three of you. ...I forced Asumu to raise a kid that wasn't hers. ...That woman wasn't anywhere near as generous and accepting as she looked. ...There's a chance she figured it out. ...However, she raised Battler, who loved her as a mother, with all the affection she had."" "
,"And in Kyrie and Battler's cases, ...he had to atone for an even greater sin. "
,He stole every moment of everyday family life that they should have shared as mother and son. 
,"Until this very day, Kyrie had believed that Battler was Asumu's child. "
,"Though she had acted kindly towards him on the surface, she had always kept a distance in her heart between herself and Asumu's son. "
,"Finally, ...Rudolf's conscience had been unable to bear seeing her like that. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...But, ...I..."" "
,"Kyrie sank into a crouch, unable to speak. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Feel free to curse me. In fact, I couldn't complain if you killed me where I stand. That's how horrible my sin against you is. ...This is the secret I wanted to confess before the cat box closes over us."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Battler...kun......"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I'm so sorry, Kyrie. ...And to you, Battler......"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Come to think of it, we've already gone through a ton of puzzles."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Now, there's only George onii-chan, Jessica onee-chan, Battler onii-chan, and {f:5:Beatrice} left."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Oh, they're finally here."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""We could hardly wait. Thought you might have forgotten about us."" "
,"Finally, we challenged George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Sorry to keep you two waiting. So, did you think up some incredibly hard ones for us?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""We decided to give you one puzzle together."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""My, my, even one riddle from this pair sounds challenging."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's a special puzzle we made just for Ange-chan, so good luck."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'll solve it. I'll definitely solve it!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Okay, then let's go. Jessica-chan, let's set them out."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""There you go."" "
,"They placed three small, colorful, cubic boxes on the table. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Two of these are traps! The other has a medal inside."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Ange-chan, do you think you can guess which one has the medal in it...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Not without a hint. That would just be luck!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""That's right. So far, this is just a test of luck with three choices. In other words, your odds of winning are one in three."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""George, this isn't a quiz. It really is just a test of luck."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""The puzzle comes later. Let's continue."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Okay, Ange. Which of these has a medal inside, do you think? Just say the first one that pops into your head."" "
,"A red box, a blue box, and a green box. There's no way to know which one it's in. "
,...This really is...a test of luck. 
,"In a way, this is even worse than a hard puzzle. After all, if you solve a hard puzzle, you'll always be right. "
,"...But in the very beginning, I picked the almond with a 1 in 15 chance. "
,"Compared to that, a 1 in 3 chance is 5 times easier to get. "
,There's no point worrying about it. Might as well test my luck again. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Then, ......this one."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""The red box? Then let's set this box right in front of you. ...Wouldn't it be great if there was a medal inside? So, let's start with a little warm-up. What's the probability of the medal being inside that red box?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""1 in 3."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. If this really is a simple test of luck."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Heheheheh. Are you sure, Ange? Are you aaabsolutely sure you're happy with that red box? After all, we're gonna make you open it in a second. ...If it's a trap, it'll be reeeally scary."" "
,Jessica onee-chan grinned threateningly. 
Ushiromiya George,"""Are you happy with the red box? ...The medal might be in the blue box or the green box. Do you want to change your mind?"" "
,"It's not fair for them to scare me like that, not after I've already made my choice. "
,And I know. 
,"All of the boxes have the same probability of having a medal in them. Whether I try to open the red box or change my mind and try the blue or green boxes, the probability will be the same. "
,"So, stick with your first choice is my motto. I'll stay with this red box. I won't change my mind. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm happy with the red box. I'll bet on it!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That's the spirit. But seriously, the traps are terrifying. Why don't we show you just how scary they are?"" "
,"Jessica onee-chan laughed creepily, then opened the green box. "
,"And then, *bang*! Pumpkin monsters and ribbon came flying out of the box. "
,"...It scared me a little. ...No, that's a lie. It scared me a lot... "
,"If that came flying out of the box I opened, right at my face, I might fall to my knees and start crying... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Ange, are you sure you want the red box...? Something really scary might come flying out, okay...? Are you sure you don't want to switch to the blue box...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm not scared! I'll stick with the red box!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Hahahahaha, you're going a bit overboard, Jessica-chan. So, one of the boxes is now gone, and there's only two left. This is where the puzzle starts, Ange-chan."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You mean, which box is the medal in?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""We have the red box that's been sitting in front of you the whole time, and the blue box here in front of me. Which has a higher probability of having a medal inside it? That's the puzzle."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Even though we don't know what's inside, there are two boxes, so there's a 50-50 chance of the medal being in either. ...They're both the same, aren't they?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I thought that too. Still, that would make the answer too obvious, wouldn't it? I wonder if there's some trick here..."" "
,"Or, that itself might be the trick, and the obvious answer could be the right one. "
,It might be one of those classic puzzles that trips you up by making you think too hard and suspiciously. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...... I have two questions for you two. Is that okay?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Go ahead."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Who do these three boxes belong to? You, Jessica-chan?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Well, yeah."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""In other words, you know which colors are traps, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Yeah, of course."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Thanks. And now for my second question. A second ago, you opened one of the boxes to show us how scary the traps were. Would you have done that no matter which of the boxes Ange-chan chose?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""That's right. I figured giving her a bit of a scare would make for a nice psychological warfare tactic."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Thanks. Those hints will be enough."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Hints? Huh...??"" "
,I'm completely lost. 
,How were Aunt Eva's questions just now hints...? 
Ushiromiya George,"""Sorry. That's wrong."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What?! ...Wh-Why?!"" "
,We started with three boxes. 
,"When they set the red box in front of me, the odds of there being a medal inside were, obviously, one in three. "
,"At the same time, the odds for the blue box were one in three, as were the odds for the green box. "
,"Jessica onee-chan opened the green box, so there were then only two boxes left, and the odds became 50-50. "
,"So, ...why was I wrong...??? "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...It was you George, wasn't it? You thought this puzzle up. Did the Monty Hall problem even exist in 1986?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Nope, not until 1990. It's a puzzle that already exists in Ange-chan's world, so I thought it'd be okay to use it."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""George nii-san ran me through the answer, but I was totally lost. ...Anyway, I don't get the details, but in this case, the odds of the blue box having the medal are about twice the odds of the red box having it."" "
,"Twice the odds? ...Even if there was a difference, I thought it'd be a tiny one. "
,...Probability is hard. 
,Didn't Onii-chan once say that people who don't get probability should never go gambling? 
,...I guess I'll never gamble for the rest of my life... 
,Aunt Eva nodded and patted my head encouragingly... 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Oh. ...The odds are better for the blue box!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Hmmm. And why is that?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Well, ...I-I just sorta..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Think back to the 15 slice cake that you found the almond in. If there was only one almond, the odds of winning were 1 in 15, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. 1 in 15."" "
,I figured that out when the cake first appeared. 
,I'd thought that waiting for a lot of people to get wrong ones would make my chances for winning higher. 
,"But, in the end, no matter when I ate my slice, the odds were still 1 in 15. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Still, Ange-chan, what if the servants were also having cake, and it started with 20 slices?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Huh? ...What...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This is a party, right? It's not fair that the servants don't get any cake, don't you think? So, let's say it was originally a 20 slice cake. The servants took out 5 slices, then redecorated it as a 15 slice cake and let you choose a slice. If so, what would your chances of choosing the right slice be?"" "
,"If there really were 20 slices, ......then the chances would be 1 in 20. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""However, the servants know where the almond is, so they chose 5 slices for themselves that had no almonds. In other words, they removed 5 losing slices. That would mean your chances of winning were 1 in 15, not 1 in 20."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...They took out losing slices, so the odds would obviously go up."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Just now, Jessica-san did the same thing. Jessica-chan removed one of the two boxes you didn't choose. In other words, the odds that the remaining box you didn't choose was the winner went up a bit, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Ahahahahahahahah, ...I sort of get it, but not really..."" "
,"If you remove a losing box, it's only natural that your chances of getting the right one go up. "
,"And just now, Jessica onee-chan removed a losing box ""from the pair of boxes I didn't choose"". "
,"So, doesn't it make sense that my odds of winning with ""those boxes"" went up...? "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Now I'm getting confused..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Actually, you really are incredible, Ange-chan. Even though you're only six, you're trying to understand posterior probability, a concept in probability theory. Probability really is interesting. I'm sure you'll like it when you get into high school and college. Go and enjoy studying it all you can."" "
,My little head was already filled to the brim. 
,"Bewildered, I had to beg Aunt Eva for an explanation. "
,Aunt Eva wore a bitter smile too. I'll bet she doesn't really get it herself. 
,"As we felt a sense of connection through this failure, we happily grasped the medals we had wrangled out of them... "
Ushiromiya George,"""Ange-chan, could you come over here for a second?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......? What is it, George onii-chan?"" "
,George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan were calling to me from the window. 
,"Aunt Eva was talking with Mom and the others, and since it looked like they'd be a while, I went over to George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It looks like the quiz tournament is almost over."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. There's only Battler onii-chan and {f:5:Beatrice} left. ...I'm starting to get sleepy."" "
,It's probably because of that adult drink I swiped from Dad. 
,"I've felt floaty ever since I drank that. ...That floaty feeling keeps getting stronger, and I've been feeling sleepy for a while now. "
,I gave a huge yawn. 
Ushiromiya George,"""Sleepy?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Yeah. If I had a sofa, I'd probably fall asleep."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I see. ...Then I guess it's almost time for this party to end."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......?"" "
,...The party will end if I fall asleep? 
,But I just wanted to take a nap while everyone else kept having fun. 
Ushiromiya George,"""Was our puzzle just now a hard one?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Yeah. I still don't really get it. ...And, ...I'm sleepy..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's called posterior probability. That's what we call it when the probability of something changes because we learn or fail to learn some piece of information."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"" "
,Did George onii-chan call me all the way over here to lecture me on math...? 
,"...For some reason, I feel even sleepier now. "
Ushiromiya George,"""So, if we have one almond in ten slices of cake, our chances of getting it are 10%. ...But what if ""we learn"" that those ten pieces were chosen at random from a hundred pieces?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""You'd think that the probability went from 1 in 10 to 1 in 100, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Absolutely nothing has changed about your slice of cake. ...Depending on whether you know or don't know a certain fact, the probability of your slice being a winner changes. Doesn't that sound strange?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...That sounds hard, so I don't wanna think about it..."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Ange, please, just listen until the end."" "
,Jessica onee-chan's voice grew a bit stern. 
,"As young as I was, ...I couldn't understand what all this was supposed to mean to me. "
Ushiromiya George,"""There's only one thing I want to tell you. So please, don't forget this."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...What?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""In the future, various bits of information will affect the slice of cake in your hands. ...By learning about those, the insides of your slice might change. Sometimes, they'll change into things you want. ...But, most likely, almost all of the changes will be bad ones."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""The truth is always right there in your hands, Ange. ...Don't you think it's stupid to let it change around just because you hear other people talking? Just because they think the truth should be one thing or another?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""The truth inside of you has been in your hands since the beginning. ...The nature of that truth...is actually something you decide for yourself. ...You change it yourself depending on what you hear...and what you refuse to listen to."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""You probably don't get what we're saying. But you have to understand. Even if you can't understand when you're 6 years old, I'm sure you will once 12 years have passed."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"" "
,"With very serious expressions on their faces, they grasped my shoulders as they spoke. "
,...I don't know what they're trying to tell me. 
Ushiromiya George,"""The truth that lies in your hands is not unchangeable. You'll be interfered with in many ways that'll make it change. ...So, if the truth in your hands is really important to you..."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""You need to protect it yourself. Don't forget it."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Next is Onii-chan and {f:5:Beatrice}'s puzzles, and then I'm done."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ah, really? Even though there were so many of us, it looks like it's finally over."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""How was it? Did you enjoy tonight's party...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. It was fun. But I think I'm a bit sleepy."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...That's no surprise, considering how much we've been running around."" "
,I rubbed my eyes. 
,"I must've gotten really excited. But whenever I get excited, I'm always tired afterwards. "
,"Right now, I'd rather have a sofa to lie on than medals. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I've got a special puzzle just for you, ...but are you sure you want it? If you're sleepy, you can stop now."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No. I've come this far, so I'll keep going... ......*yaaawn*..."" "
,Onii-chan and Beato laughed at my yawn. 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Looks like it's time to call it a day..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. Ange, let us leave my puzzle for later. It's too difficult to be solved by one with eyes as sleepy as that."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......No way. ...I've...come this far, and... ...I also want...Onii-chan's medal......"" "
,I'm just so...so sleepy... ............ 
,Ange drifted over to a chair in the corner of the room and plopped down onto it. 
,"Then, she closed her eyes and sat there like a doll. "
,It didn't take long before the cute sound of her breathing in her sleep could be heard... 
,"When she saw that Ange was finally asleep, Beato spoke softly. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Quiet please, everyone. ...Ange fell asleep."" "
,"When she spoke, the peaceful clatter that filled the room fell silent. Everyone looked down into Ange's sleeping face. "
,"Each of them wore an affectionate gaze, as if they'd just watched a baby finally drift to sleep. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...Did Ange-chan have a good time?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""But of course. ...The feeling might not be so strong now, but one day, she will surely remember tonight's party and understand how fun it was."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...You're right."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...It was fun for us too, getting to play with Ange-chan."" "
,"By this point, everyone was standing in a wide circle around Ange as she slept. "
,"Now that the guest of honor was asleep, ...this Halloween party had reached its conclusion... "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""So long, my granddaughter. ...I was so pleased to have this chance to play with you again after 12 years. ...It matters not if you forget everything about me. Remember me as an arrogant despot. ...But, every now and then, just try and remember how much I adored you."" "
Nanjo Terumasa,"""She will remember. ...Ange-san, you have a long life ahead of you. Even after 12 years, there is still much for you to experience. I pray that you find this life meaningful and worthwhile."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...You are the final grandchild and daughter of the Ushiromiya family. All of us pray for your happiness."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Ange-chan, stay well. ...Happiness isn't something you find, it's something you make. And in fact, memories work the same way."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""True. ...There are some things that we only truly understand when we think back on them years later."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Make sure you remember my pretty face every now and then. Just havin' you remember us is the greatest memorial service we could ever have."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Oh, come on. It's not like we're dying. We're just going to the inside of the cat box, ...the other side of the curtain."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right. It's not even a curtain. It's just like we are now. Ange-chan's there sleepin' away. The rest of us are right by her side, watchin' over her. We'll always be with her."" "
,"All of them still wore warm smiles, but the sound of sniffling came from several places throughout the room... "
,This party wasn't only for the girl who wasn't able to be here this day. 
,"It was also for all those people who weren't able to meet her here, ...who never had the chance to say goodbye... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Ange, live life strongly. ...Our blood flows through your veins. That'll definitely bring you strength."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Eva nee-san, take care of our daughter. ...She's not honest with herself, and she'll often be selfish and short-tempered. She might be a pain all the time, but..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I'll make sure...she finds happiness. As long as she wants it herself..."" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""Ange-sama, ...it's okay if you forget my face. But please, at least remember the taste of my cooking...!"" "
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohhohohohohohohoho. And I won't ask you to remember old Kumasawa. But please, at least remember the taste of mackerel juice."" "
,"Someone said ""When'd you feed her that?!"" and everyone laughed wryly. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Her face looks so cute, sleeping there like that. ...She looks like an angel, just like her name."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""She's not an angel, she's a witch. Ange's the final witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I wonder if that magic will bring her happiness."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Will she become a white witch or a black witch? ...That's for Ange to choose. I've shown her both sides."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I'm sure a painful life lies ahead for you. You'll probably believe that you're all alone in this world. ...But we will always be there right behind you, cheering you on. Don't forget that..."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Ange, ...don't forget. Your self, your happiness, your fate... These are all things you create for yourself. Only you can choose them. No one else can give you them, and no one else can hide them from you. ...Don't forget that."" "
Kanon,"""I'm sure your message reached her."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...I hope so."" "
Kanon,"""I'm certain the tale of the two of us will help Ange-sama understand."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Yeah."" "
Shannon,"""Don't you have anything to tell her, George-sama?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...I've already said all I wanted with that box puzzle."" "
Shannon,"""Will that puzzle teach her something?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I don't know. But I do know that she's wise. I'm sure she'll learn something from it."" "
Shannon,"""...Ange-sama, I pray that you're guided along the right path as you move towards the future."" "
,"One by one, they stepped forward and said words of farewell to Ange. "
,"Then, finally, Battler and Beato walked forward... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ange, ...were you able to remember everyone, at least a little bit?"" "
,"Of course, Ange didn't answer in her sleep. But Battler continued. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's true that the Ushiromiyas are a strange family. We're super-rich, and that's given rise to all sorts of rumors and stories. ...However, that's all speculation made by people outside the island."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...No one will blame you for forgetting these kind memories, young as you were. But even so, you must remember. ...It is not a sin to forget. ...But to not remember again...is a sin."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""All of us... ...were really happy to have you at this party. Right, everyone?"" "
,Everyone nodded at Battler's words. 
,Everyone knew about the merciless and lonely life that awaited her. 
,It was no longer possible for them to heal those wounds. 
,If there was one thing they could do... 
,"...It was to make her remember what a kind, fun family she once had. ...To remind her that, both today and into the future, they would always care for her and watch over her. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It goes without saying... that this is an illusion. You cannot come to Rokkenjima on October 4th, 1986. This whole party we shared was all a magical illusion, created by the Game Master, Battler."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But you've remembered, right...? You've remembered the truth... ...about how kind everyone was, and how much of a blast we all had at the family conferences, right...?"" "
,Ange breathed softly in her sleep. 
,Who knows...if those words truly reached her...? 
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aunt Eva."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Take care of her."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Do you...really think...that I deserve to become her mother...?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I do. ...Even though your own sadness was so unbearable, ...you tried so hard to be a mother for Ange."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But, in the end......"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's okay. ...Ange, listen carefully."" "
,"Battler grasped Ange's hand, then took Eva's hand and joined the two hands together... "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...We know that a tragic fate leads to a future where you two hurt each other. ...It's a sad thing for Ange...and just as sad for Aunt Eva. ...It would've been cruel to ask you to open your heart to her. Likewise, it would've been cruel to ask Aunt Eva to keep on overcoming her sadness after being rejected."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Neither of you is at fault."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Even so, we have no right to tell you to forgive her. ...So, we won't. ...Just try and understand. It doesn't matter how long it takes, how far into the future it happens. Just try and understand Aunt Eva. And, every once in a while, ......remember us."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I concur. And, every once in a while, remember this merry, cheerful, attractive paragon of a woman, and chant my name in praise three times every day."" "
,"The relatives smiled bitterly, apparently disagreeing with some of that last bit. "
,Eva softly stroked Ange's cheek and spoke one last time. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...It's okay if you don't forgive your aunt. ...But... it's true that I don't hate you. ...At least understand that..."" "
,"Eva wiped her eyes and slowly stood up. Hideyoshi held her shoulder, and Rudolf and Kyrie gathered around her too. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Genji-san, would you mind carrying Ange to somewhere she can lie down?"" "
Ronoue Genji,"""As you wish. ...Shall I take her to the guesthouse?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It would be a little too sad to leave her there all alone."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You're right. ...Could you carry her to a sofa in the parlor? That way, she'll be able to come back if she wakes up and feels like joining in again."" "
,Genji gently lifted Ange up and carried her towards the parlor. 
,Everyone continued to watch over her as she left... 
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Shannon, Kanon. In the end, how many medals did Ange gather?"" "
Shannon,"""...She didn't get any medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 1 medal."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 2 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 3 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 4 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 5 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 6 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 7 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 8 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 9 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 10 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 11 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 12 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 13 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 14 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 15 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 16 medals."" "
Shannon,"""...She got 17 medals."" "
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmm, I see. ...Then place this by her pillow."" "
Kanon,"""Yes, as you wish."" "
,Genji carried Ange to the parlor and set her down on the sofa. 
,Shannon quietly laid a warm blanket on top of her. 
,"Kanon placed a message card by her pillow, along with that thing Kinzo had handed them. "
,The message card read as follows: 
,"{a:c:We'll all be with you, always. {n}{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}From the whole Ushiromiya family} "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a scrubbing brush. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a can of mackerel. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a memory foam pillow with the One-winged Crest. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......an old‐type white school swimsuit. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a fully ripe mango. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a decorative pine branch. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a uniform from Angel Mort. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a signed celebrity photograph of Kinzo himself. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a bag that laughs with Kinzo's voice. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a One‐winged Eagle carp streamer. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a bouquet of golden roses. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a music box that was passed down through the generations. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a mass‐produced Sakutarou doll. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a tea set bearing the family crest. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a pocket watch bearing the family crest. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a {f:5:Beatrice} corsage. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a Battler doll. "
,"And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a {f:5:Beatrice} doll. "
,"Ange, mumbling in her sleep, held it tightly against her cheek. "
Ronoue Genji,"""Let us go. We mustn't wake her."" "
Kanon,"""Nee-san."" "
Shannon,"""...Yeah. ......?"" "
,Shannon thought she saw something glittering silver near Ange's eye... 
,"The servants left and closed the parlor door. As Ange slept, she was wrapped up in the soft sound of the rain. "
,"Surely, she was reliving that fun evening once more in her dreams... "
