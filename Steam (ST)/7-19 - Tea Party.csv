Speaker,Steam (ST)
,"......When I came to, all was silent. The room was dimly lit. And yet...it was massive. "
,...Where on earth...is this...? 
,"I was sitting in what seemed to be a very short sofa. It was very constricting, and looked like there were several more of them off to each side of me... "
,"Once I noticed that, I realized that I was in a theater. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Where on earth...am I...?"" "
,"I don't know how long I've been here. And, more importantly, I don't know where this is. "
,"...Beatrice's funeral ended, everyone went back to the mansion, and... "
,"...And after that, my memory gets fuzzy, and I can't recall anything else. "
,"Then, I was surprised to notice the presence of another person. "
,"Apparently, I wasn't the only one sitting in the audience seating of this vast theater. "
,...The sound had come from a seat to the side of mine. 
,"When I looked, I saw a girl sitting several seats off to my left. "
,"It was a face I had never seen before. ...Who is she? She looked like a high-schooler or a college student, about the same age as I was. "
,"""......Nnn..."" "
,"She groaned. Apparently, she had just woken up... "
,"I didn't want to scare her, so I decided to introduce myself first... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Hello."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........!!"" "
,"Apparently, she was equally surprised to find someone other than herself here. She jumped when she heard my greeting. "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Who the hell are you?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I feel the same way. ...It seems that neither of us is here of our own accord."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Is that...the One-Winged Crest...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Huh? ...Do you recognize this crest?"" "
,She looked suspiciously at the One-Winged Crest emblazoned on my collar. 
,"Her stare, which was unmoving but not openly hostile, wasn't exactly pleasant for me. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Allow me to introduce myself first. ...I am Ushiromiya Lion."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Ushiromiya, ...huh? What?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Lion. Written as ""{p:0:睆御}"", but pronounced ""Lee-on"". ...Pretty strange name, don't you think?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...No stranger than mine. But I'll have to apologize. I don't know who you are."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""That's hardly surprising, since I don't know you either."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's not what I meant. Who are you? There's no one like you in the Ushiromiya family."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""And why are you so sure? Do you have something to do with my family?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm a member of the Ushiromiya family."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...But that's..."" "
,She showed me her left sleeve...and the crest of the One-Winged Eagle emblazoned upon it. 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...I regret having to ask the same question, but who are you? I've never seen you in the Ushiromiya family."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...... ...First they tear me into little bits, then they make me read... ...What's next? Which witch am I supposed to be entertaining this time?"" "
,She spat out those words and seemed to be complaining about something. 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Ange. ...I'm Ushiromiya Ange. Rudolf and Kyrie's daughter."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""What?! ...A-Ange-chan...?! But you're supposed to be six years old..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I was six during the year of the final family conference on Rokkenjima. ...Now I get it. So, you're a person from the year 1986. I'm 18 years old. And I'm from the year 1998."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I-In other words, ...you're the Ange-chan...of 12 years in the future...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm glad you believe it. But, unfortunately, I don't have a clue who you are. ...Who are you? Who are your parents?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""My father is Krauss. Natsuhi is my mother."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That would make you Jessica onee-chan."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Jessica is my little sister."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...... ...What's going on? Wasn't Jessica onee-chan an only child...?"" "
,"By this point, I was starting to figure out the situation this Ange had come from. "
,"...She's probably from the world where I awakened as a witch, ...the world where Lion doesn't exist. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""It will be a bit difficult to explain, ...but think of it this way. In a world slightly different from the one you know, I am also a member of the Ushiromiya family. In your world, a different fate leads me to walk a different path through life, so that I do not live as an Ushiromiya family member."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Are you...a witch...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just an ordinary human. ...What I just told you is something I heard from the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel}-san."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......{f:5:Bernkastel}? That one with the long, blue hair and the gloomy face...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Y-Yes. That probably fits her, I think..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......In other words, I've been forced to play along with another witch's farce. ...Just where is this place?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I only woke up a second ago myself. ...I'm wondering the same thing."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It looks like a theater. ...Are we supposed to watch a play or something?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...I'm really not in the mood now. Let's look for an exit."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......You haven't noticed yet? Look."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Huh? ......Ah, these are..."" "
,*clank*. 
,I finally noticed. Both of my wrists and ankles had chains attached to them. 
,"As long as I sat here, I had enough slack that I could move about a little, but it looked like there wouldn't be nearly enough for me to get out of this place. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...When did...? ...Who would do something like this...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Once a witch has made you her piece, you'll be their plaything forever. ...There's no way to escape."" "
,"Ange crossed her legs, making the chains clank together. "
,She realized that no amount of struggling could have broken those chains. ...Getting panicky wouldn't accomplish anything. She must've had nerves of steel. 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""What do you mean, a witch's piece?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...It's like being their slave. ...I made a deal, once. ...I said I wanted to see my family, to bring them back from that day. In exchange for making that a possibility, that witch turned me into a witch's piece. ......At least the witch kept her promise. I was able to see Onii-chan again."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...You mean Battler-kun...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Well, I wasn't even able to tell him who I was. ...And, in exchange for that short bit of time, I'm now trapped inside the witches' toy box for all eternity. ...Looks like you are too. ...Did you make some sort of contract?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""N-Nothing of the sort..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Did you ever ask a witch to grant a wish for you?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Never. ......She taught me what a miracle my existence is. That's all."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Either way, neither of us is getting out of here. ...Okay, witches! What kind of show do you have for us this time?! Have we moved from reading aloud to theatergoing? Am I supposed to watch someone else read aloud this time, or what?! If that's it, then start it up already. I'm bored enough as it is!"" "
,"Ange yelled this to the pitch-black stage. Her voice reverberated throughout the theater, but no one gave an answer... "
,"...No, someone did. And that was also in a voice that rang out across the theater. "
,"However, that voice sounded theatrical, as though someone was announcing the start of a play. "
,"""What happened on that day, you ask? I'm not telling. If only you'd just give up and die!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Whose voice was that...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That old hag. It was Aunt Eva's voice."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""What does she mean by ""what happened on that day""?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...She's talking about the 4th and 5th of October in the year 1986. ...The day of the final family conference on Rokkenjima."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""In other words, ...today."" "
,"Today is October 4th, 1986. "
,"As a prelude to the family conference, Beatrice's funeral was held... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's a surprise. So, you've come here from October 4th, 1986? Tell me. What happened during those two days...?!"" "
,The answer she seeks is inside the cat box. All I can tell her about is my close call with a sad life. 
,"However, I doubt that explanation will satisfy her. "
,"Then, ...a pillar of bright light pierced the stage. "
,There stood a white shadow. ...That white dress was obviously Clair's. 
,"Of course, Ange didn't recognize her. She looked suspicious, apparently wondering who in the world this was. "
,"However, even I felt as though something was wrong. "
,"...Didn't she settle all of her regrets in that funeral a short while ago, before being sent off into the next world...? "
,"She stood all alone in the narrow beam of light in the center of the stage, and the expression on her face was lifeless. "
,The light began to grow brighter and brighter. 
,"It shone more and more fiercely on her, until it became blinding just to look at her. "
,"The world was enveloped by a light so bright that we couldn't open our eyes, surrounded by a sound like wind or television static, ...and our minds began to go blank... "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Whoo...! They're bloomin' wonderfully again this year!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It must be a pain to take care of all these. Pretty easy for us though, just looking at 'em."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle* I agree. We've got to thank the people who take care of them for us."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But it is a bit lacking in grace. I prefer the way it used to be, before Nii-san decided to pile so much on."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""The old look did have its own charm, didn't it?"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-! I love roses! I'd like them even more if they didn't have thorns! Uu-!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Whoa! This rose garden really takes me back! I'd totally forgotten about it these past six years...!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I guess it really has been that long. Both you and this garden have changed so much."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Ah, let me introduce you! This is Kanon-kun, one of our servants! This is the first time you've met Battler, right?"" "
Kanon,"""...Pleased to meet you."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You can just call me Battler! Nice to meet you!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Shannon's here too, today. Remember when we used to play together?"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ah, ...Shannon-chan! I'd totally forgotten... That really takes me back! How's she been doing?!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""She's grown more and more beautiful these past six years. You should say hi to her later on."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Shannon and George onii-chan are reeeally good friends! Uu-!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Maria, shhh! That's a secret!"" "
Gohda Toshiro,"""If you would, everyone, allow me to guide you to the guesthouse."" "
,"After enjoying the lovely welcome provided by the roses, the relatives followed Gohda in the direction of the guesthouse... "
,"October 4th, 1986. "
,Rokkenjima. In a world without Lion. ...On the day of the Ushiromiya family conference. 
,"Maria read a mysterious letter aloud after dinner, just as she had been told to. "
,The writer of the letter claimed to be the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} and challenged the family. 
,"Try and solve the riddle of the epitaph. Otherwise, I will take everything. "
,"It was {f:5:Beatrice}'s announcement of the game's start, the same as the usual games. "
,"Had an unknown person appeared, related to the problem of the inheritance's distribution? Where was the 20 billion yen worth of gold hidden? What was the purpose of this letter? For what goal had it been written? Who on earth is this {f:5:Beatrice}? "
,"It was the usual dinner on October 4th, ...where several bits of suspicion and paranoia intertwined. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""George-kun, I'm sorry, but could you go to the guesthouse with the others? My apologies."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Shannon, take the children to the guesthouse. We will move straight on to the family conference."" "
Shannon,"""Y-Yes. As you wish..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""{f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch... What a fascinating letter you've sent us..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""She's telling us to solve the epitaph...? Ridiculous. That gold belongs to us. Why would we ever give it up to some outsider...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...If we could just find that gold, we'd all be happy. No one would have to lose anything."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Let's go, everyone. They'll be having an adult conversation from here on out..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Sheesh. Sounds like it's gonna get complicated."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Come on, Maria... Let's go..."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Beato's ceremony has begun... Kihihihihihihi..."" "
Shannon,"""Okay, everyone, ...I shall guide you to the guesthouse..."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...What's...all this about...?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Probably a replay of one of the old games, ...or else an entirely new game. In all the games, October 4th happens in pretty much the same way."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...A new game? You mean, a tale that hasn't appeared in any of the Fragments so far?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""There's no way they'd go to the trouble of chaining us down if they just wanted to show us a game we already know. ...It's probably a new game. That means there should be a Game Master. ...Who is it? ...That witch? {f:5:Bernkastel}...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I...can't imagine so. ...Clair should have vanished already. There should be no need to spin up a new tale..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Beato's game board was hijacked by those evil witches long ago. Even Beato is nothing more than a piece in their games."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Just who is behind this, ...and what are they after? What do they want to show us...?"" "
,"Before this tale began, Clair definitely appeared on the stage. "
,"She is the teller of the tale of {f:5:Beatrice}'s game. {f:5:Beatrice}, the ""me"" from a world of a different fate. "
,"However, didn't she entrust everything to Will, who solved all of the riddles? "
,There should be no need for her to make new riddles... 
,"...In that case, is {f:5:Bernkastel} using this tale to test me...? "
,"Along with Will, I have at least touched the deepest depths of this tale...and understood the culprit's heart. "
,"So, even if an entirely new tale presents itself, I should be able to see through the riddles. "
,...Is that...what my role is...? Is my role to teach Ange about the truth of this tale...? 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Do you know? ...Do you know the truth of this tale?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I have several theories. Still, none of those can give a conclusive answer. The truth is always inside the cat box. I can't say anything for sure."" "
,"In this world, Ange is absent on this day. So, it's only natural that she doesn't know what happened. "
,"However, at the very least, I do know who the culprit is...and what they were trying to do on this day... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...I think... I've finally understood my role in this."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What do you mean?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Apparently, you're here as a theatergoer, and I'm here as a commentator."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Then as a commentator, what exactly is it you're going to explain for me?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""After all, ......I know who's behind the crime that's about to occur."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What did you say...?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Thinking about it straightforwardly, ...the only explanation I see is that someone's trying to make us solve the epitaph, hoping to then snatch the gold for themselves."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I agree. If they'd already solved it, they could just take it. There'd be no need to challenge us to solve the riddle."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's a prank by one of the servants. They must be hoping to pick up the scraps from the celebration if the gold is found."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I cannot imagine that any of our servants would do such a thing..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Or, maybe one of us sent the letter, pretending to be a servant."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If that's it, you're the most suspicious one. You schooled Maria-chan on her part and made her read the letter, didn't you?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I-I wouldn't do that...!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Give that a rest, Eva. We can't jump to conclusions. Isn't this the time for us all to stick together?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's right. The aim of this strange letter is probably to disrupt our unity. The more we let it affect us, the more things will go the way of this ""{f:5:Beatrice}"" who sent it."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Kyrie-san's right. Wouldn't it be best to simply ignore a letter like that from the start?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That is what I have been saying this whole time. This sort of prank is not worth considering!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Yes, that's it exactly. If a couple improbable claims for damages get ya flustered, you'll never be able to sell anythin'!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""My husband's right. This is a child's prank, and taking it seriously is just a waste of time. If someone really wanted to shake up the inheritance issue, they'd come forward boldly instead of using something this roundabout."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You've got it right there. Someone probably wants to make us think there's another person trying to make demands about the inheritance, when their real goal is just to pick up the scraps."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I wonder if they'll ask for some hush money in exchange for staying out of the inheritance issue."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""If that were the case, they should have written it into the letter."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""And the letter is just a challenge, telling us to try solving the epitaph or else hand over everything."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""The culprit is tryin' to make us solve the epitaph's riddle! Nothin' more, nothin' less."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""So, it's simple. If we worry about this letter, we lose."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Indeed, I agree. ...After that big mysterious show, like something out of a mystery novel, we've all gotten a bit too wrapped up in this. ...Hahahaha. It seems we're all taking this too seriously."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""But who did it? ...Such an aggravating thing to do."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If it wasn't a servant, then one of us must have written it. I'm not naming names, of course."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""St-Stop it. I really know nothing about this...!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Settle down. Anyway, what this letter says does make a bit of sense. ...All of us need money. And, if possible, we need it right away. No one here has any objections to that, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Of course not. Whether it's money or love, you can never have too much."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""We don't know when Father's inheritance will come to us. ...However, the gold of the epitaph is different. If we find it, we could just split it then and there."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""In a sense, it's even closer to us now than the inheritance is."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Assuming we can solve the epitaph..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Everyone here has tried solving it on their own, yes?"" "
,"Kyrie asked the room at large, and everyone wordlessly nodded back. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Here, we have four people who have inherited the blood of the one who made that riddle, ...and each has tried solving it on their own. That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...True. We've all been greedy and tried to go it alone. ...However, we've already reached a decision about how we'll split the gold up if it's found. And about acknowledging Aniki as the Successor."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Though you demanded quite a lot in exchange."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I wonder if we can solve that epitaph...if we pool our efforts and work together..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Two heads are better than one. And here, we have seven."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Today, we reached a general agreement about the inheritance problem. ...Why not take a shot at the epitaph for a bit of fun on the side?"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Nice idea. Let's give it a try and call it a break."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Ridiculous. Of course there's no hidden gold..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Take it easy. Just think of it as a game. Let's have Gohda-san bring us something cool to drink. We can take a break and all play with riddles as a big, happy bunch of siblings for once."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hmmm. Well, the night is long. It would at least be more productive than pointless inquiries into Father's health."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I'll ring up Gohda-san. He can bring us something."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Let's have tea and sweets. ...Oh, and a map of Taiwan."" "
,Two shadows could be seen in the rose garden arbor. ...It was George and Shannon's secret meeting. 
Ushiromiya George,"""I want you to take this ring."" "
Shannon,"""...G-George-sama..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I swear to love you all my life. ...Not just now, while we're young. I swear to love you and keep you happy until we get old and go to our graves."" "
Shannon,"""...And are there any lies or exaggerations in your words?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""No, not one. I'm confident in my resolve to love you and build a happy household together with you."" "
Shannon,"""And what would this happy household be like?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Well, it will be full of happiness. We'll have a house, with a car and a yard. And one dog. The yard will have a vegetable garden. The kids will run around, and we'll smile down on them from the balcony. That's what our typical future Sunday will look like."" "
Shannon,"""That...would be wonderful..."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Whaaaat?!! Those two're going out?!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Shhh! Why are you so damn loud?! Maria'll wake up...!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I-I see. So that's how it is... Now that you mention it, they seemed to have a pretty good mood going on there. ...That's right, we're about the age where you fall in love."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""We've changed a lot in the last six years. George nii-san used to be a bit unreliable, but he isn't anymore."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's what I thought. George-aniki's got that ""air of dignity"" thing going."" "
,"...But still, Shannon-chan and George-aniki. That's a bit unexpected. "
,"They played together often enough six years ago, but I didn't think they were that close. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Well, six years is a long time."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""These six years have been huge for all of us."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yep. ...A lot's happened to me these six years, and to be honest, I've forgotten almost everything about Rokkenjima."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""And I'd forgotten almost everything about you too."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Now that really hurts, ihihi!"" "
,"Talking together like this, it felt as though we'd been teleported six years into the past. "
,"Six long years, so long that I forgot almost everything. And yet, it's coming back to me, bit by bit. "
,......Shannon-chan. 
,"Six years ago, you were part of our group, and we played together a lot, didn't we... "
,"Back then, I think I might've...liked Shannon-chan. "
,"That was the age when we were all overly self-conscious, in love with love. "
,"Bittersweet memories of jokes involving melodramatic, flippant words. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...That takes me back. I think I remember saying all kinds of stuff that I'd be way too embarrassed to say now. Gyaaah, just remembering it is making my face go red!"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Hihihi. Shannon might be a scatterbrain, but her memory's incredible. Guess I'll just have to ask her all about your dark, embarrassing history."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Qu-Quit it. That was six years ago, the statute of limitations has gotta be up...!"" "
,"...I see. So, Shannon-chan is going out with George-aniki. "
,......... 
,What am I thinking? Could this be...jealousy? 
,"I didn't really think about it until now, ...but that thing Shannon-chan and I had back then...was probably my first love. "
,"Well, it's not like I have any right to be jealous, after forgetting the whole thing until we met again. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Everyone knows that Dad's hometown was Taishou in Taiwan."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""He still chews areca nuts from time to time in memory of that place. Apparently, he got hooked on that instead of smoking when he was young."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...But there must be several rivers there with sweetfish swimming in them."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It has several mountain streams that are famous sweetfish fishing spots. ...Anyway, you could probably find sweetfish living anywhere the water was clean. We're completely stuck."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Maybe it was just some nearby creek Father played in as a kid. He said sweetfish, but maybe we're lookin' for somethin' more like carp."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Or, it could be some sort of metaphor. The river isn't necessarily a river with water flowing through it."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""What do you mean by that...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Well now... ...Who knows?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Kyrie has a point there. Isn't it a bit too early to be sure that Taiwan is this homeland, or that this sweetfish river is a river with water flowing down it?"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""If we look at it that way, we're just stuck again. The more you think about this riddle, the harder it gets."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...That's it. This is just a riddle. ...Kyrie-san is right. We need to be flexible in our thinking..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""If we're looking for a river near Taishou, ...that would have to be Danshui River..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Are you even listening?! We just said that it might not be the kind of river with water flowing down it! Is there any proof that this river is a sweetfish river?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Y-You're right... I-I'm sorry..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Well, it probably did have sweetfish in it. After all, ""danshui"" does mean freshwater. Makes sense that a freshwater fish like sweetfish would be swimming in it."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Sweetfish are freshwater fish. So, a sweetfish river would be a freshwater river. ...Is that how we get Danshui River? Hahahaha, quite the word game."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Now that's an interesting theory. ...Let's advance our reasoning a bit further. As you travel down the river, you will see a village. ...What's the name of the town at the mouth of Danshui River?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......It says ""Danshui"" here."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I went sightseeing in Danshui. It was a calm and gentle harbor town. Beautiful sunsets."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Did you find ""the shore the two will tell you of""?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Not really. It doesn't ring any bells."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I guess the beloved hometown wasn't in Taiwan. It might have been Odawara after all."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""If we can't discount any possibilities, ...then we won't get anywhere. We can't even get past the first line of the epitaph."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Quiet, you're distracting me! ...It has to be Taiwan. Father wouldn't describe any other place as ""beloved""!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...That is one thing we can agree upon. To this very day, Taiwan is the homeland of Father's heart."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""It's probably best if we don't spend too much time on the first line. I'm going to take a look at the others. ...Just a quick peek, starting at the first twilight."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Me too. I'll leave the sweetfish river to you, Aneki, and have a go at the second half."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices... How mysterious."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I-I've got it."" "
,Eva suddenly muttered. All of the others spun around to look at her. 
,"Eva was flipping through the pages about Taiwan with incredible force, then found the page she was looking for and slammed the book open so hard that it almost tore. "
,"This whole time, the book had been opened to the page with place names. As far as the overall mass of information went, this seemed the most useful page to start from. "
,"However, the page Eva opened to was very limited in the scope of its information. "
,It was...a map of railway lines. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...As you travel down the river, ...there's a village, ...a village. ......!! There it is, the village!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Wh-What are you talking about, Eva? Explain yourself."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Quiet!! There's a shore too, and a mouth...! I'm not sure what it means by ""the two"", ...but there definitely is a village and a shore and a mouth...!! This has to be it... This is definitely the village where the key to the gold sleeps...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""C-Calm down...! Explain it so we can understand too!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...The Danshui Line? ...I see. So, the sweetfish river was actually a railroad called the Danshui Line?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Well, I doubt there are any sweetfish swimming there..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Look!! If we follow the Danshui Line down, there's a station that used to be known as Kirigan! Look at the characters it's written in!! There's a village ({p:0:里}), a mouth ({p:0:口}), and a shore ({p:0:岸})!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Sh-She's right...! There's a village, mouth, and shore...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......As you travel down the river, you will see a village. ...True, that's the only station on the Danshui Line that has the character for village in its name."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I see, it's like a code pointing towards this station's name..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This has to be it! There's no doubt...!! We just need to look a bit further, and we'll definitely find out what ""the two who speak"" means...!! ...L-Look!! This is it! This is it!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""The region around the station has the same name, except with a mouth in the second character. ...That makes a total of two mouths in Kirigan. Are those ""the two who speak""?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I-Incredible, Nee-san. This has to be it..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Does this mean that the key is hidden somewhere in this town of Kirigan...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I wonder. ...The whole riddle so far has been a word game. If so, isn't it likely that the sleeping key is also a word game?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I agree. On the first twilight, the key selects six sacrifices, right? So, it's hard to imagine that it's actually something key-shaped...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Whoo. ...This is getting...damn interesting..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Offer up the six chosen by the key. ...Let's think of a key that's somehow related to this! And let's break down this name, ""Kirigan""! I'm absolutely sure that this is a word game! It has to be...!! Think, everyone!!"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""That's interesting. ...Though this rain would get me down if I were alone, it feels nice and cool when you're by my side."" "
Shannon,"""...It's about time for us to head back. I'm keeping Kanon-kun waiting."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""You're right. And I've probably kept Jessica-chan and Battler-kun waiting."" "
Shannon,"""It brings back good memories. Remember when the four of us used to play together? ...It was a lot of fun back then too."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""To me, it's a lot more fun now. Because I get you all to myself."" "
Shannon,"""*giggle* ...Oh, George-sama."" "
,"They laughed at George's melodramatic line. However, George's laugh seemed just slightly forced. "
Shannon,"""...George-sama?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Hmm? ...Oh, I'm sorry. ......Well, I guess I still have a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to Battler-kun."" "
Shannon,"""An...inferiority complex?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Like Uncle Rudolf, he's lively, interesting, and just full of energy. He's much more attractive than I am. ...I can tell how much he outshines me when we're together."" "
Shannon,"""That's not true. You're very accomplished and attractive. You aren't worse than Battler-sama in any way."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Really?"" "
Shannon,"""Yes. Really."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""The truth is... ...When I first heard that Battler-kun would be coming back this year, ...I wasn't happy about it."" "
Shannon,"""Why not...?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Six years ago, ...Battler-kun was the one who was really close to you. I wanted to get closer to you, but I just couldn't manage to get between the two of you. ...You two just looked so good together that I could do nothing but watch on longingly."" "
Shannon,"""Is that how it was...? Wasn't it just Battler-sama making fun of me one-sidedly..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Of course you looked incredibly good together. There's no doubt about that. ...I was sure that you two were going out."" "
Shannon,"""That never happened. You're overthinking it..."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......I really am pathetic. I was afraid that when I handed you this ring today, you'd refuse."" "
Shannon,"""Why is that? ...Why should I refuse your ring, George-san?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Because...Battler-kun came back. I was afraid that you might like Battler-kun even now... ...and that, now that he's here, you wouldn't have any use for me."" "
Shannon,"""......George-san? Please, look at this. You see this silver glint on my ring finger? What do you think that is?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...You're right. Sorry. What's got me so shaken, I wonder. ...I'm probably still jealous of him, now that he's gotten even cooler these past six years. ...How pathetic."" "
Shannon,"""No, it's okay. Those feelings are a sign that your love for me is so strong, you don't want to give me up to anyone. ...If you're worried about my feelings switching to Battler-sama, just love me all the stronger so that such a thing would be unthinkable. ...Love me so much that I don't have time to think about other men."" "
Shannon,"""I'm scared too. I'm sure you'll meet many women in the future who are much more attractive than me. Or, you might tire of me when I don't match up to your expectations. It scares me to think that I might not be able to grasp hold of your feelings for the rest of my life."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""There's no need for you to be scared of that. I swear to love you all my life."" "
Shannon,"""But even though I swore the same thing, you're having trouble believing it just because Battler-sama came back."" "
,"As Shannon giggled, George finally realized that his own lack of confidence had hurt her... "
Shannon,"""...I've fallen for a wonderful man named Ushiromiya George-san. And this is a man who has sworn to love me all his life, and who has given me a ring as a sign of this oath. With this ring here on my ring finger, I can give an honest confession."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Sure."" "
Shannon,"""Yes, as you said, ...I did like Battler-sama six years ago. I think I probably liked him more than you."" "
Shannon,"""However, that was six years ago. Now, things are different. In these six years, I've sorted out my feelings for Battler-sama, and cut myself off from them along with the memories of the past. Now, I exist only to love you."" "
,Shannon spoke clearly and strongly... 
,"George gave a single, uncertain laugh. It was probably the same sort of laugh the George of six years ago had made. "
,"Then, he stretched resolutely and hugged Shannon without saying a word. In that moment, he said goodbye to the person he had been six years ago... "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""I've got the ladder...! Here we go!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""<Quadrillion>. ...This is the only place you'll find that number written on this island."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""One tenth of ten quadrillion... How suspicious."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""If our idea is right, there should be some sort of device embedded in that relief."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""We just need to check. Who's going up?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I'll go. Hold that ladder down, okay?"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Be careful. It is fairly high up..."" "
,"Rudolf climbed up the propped-up ladder. Step by step, as the rain poured down on him... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Look at the ""q"". See anything? Some sort of device?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Nnn... Ladder's a bit shaky. ...Hmm? Oh boy..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What is it?! Did something happen?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Heheh... Bingo. Take a look at this."" "
,"Rudolf tossed the ""q"" down. It hit Krauss on the shoulder and landed in a puddle. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""This is...the key!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""What does it mean?! Rudolf-kun, don't tell me you can take out the other letters too?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Yeah, looks like it. Guess our crazy theories weren't far off after all! What's the next letter to take out?!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""U-Ummm, ""i""! And then ""l""!"" "
,"Following her instructions, Rudolf removed the six letters of the first twilight... "
,"Now that they'd gotten this far, ...nothing stood in the way of them solving the riddle. "
,"By trial and error, ...they finally reached the final stage. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""It says to gouge starting from the head, which must mean going from left to right."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Rudolf-san! Starting from the left, turn the keys before taking them out!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Got it...! "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"Now, we've massacred all of the letters. We reached the ninth twilight, and none are left alive."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""So?! Did something happen?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It felt like something clicked, but nothing changed. Did a hidden door open up somewhere?"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""H-Hey! Look at that! It moved, I'm sure it did!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......?! Everyone, look! The lion statue's facing the other way...!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Wh-What is going on? Is there some secret inside the lion statue...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...That's not it. It's probably telling us to look where the lion's pointing. See? Look that way."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That lion's facing a different way too...! What does it mean?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's guiding us, stupid! We have to go in the direction the lions face...!"" "
,Eva dashed forward. The others all chased after her. 
,...The gold was right in front of them. 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Now this is a surprise. Who would have thought that a hidden stairway like this existed?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It makes sense now. Father didn't like people going near the chapel..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I wonder how long that device has been there. Judging by the feel of this underground passage, probably for quite a long time..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I imagine it was built at nearly the same time as the mansion itself. ...The riddle of the epitaph was probably also planned many decades ago."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Well, this is Dad we're talking about. ...I try not to let the things he does surprise me, but this..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Just how far does this stairway go...?"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Hey, maybe that old rumor was true. ...You know, the story about him having a mistress in a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I see. It's likely that this underground passage goes all the way there."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I wonder if it connects to the mansion from that day..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I think we've found the goal. ...Look at that filthy door. Something's written on it."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Whew. Bingo."" "
,Something was written on the door in red paint. 
,"On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Does it open...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It does. ...Ready? I'm going to open it."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""So, we've finally reached the gold..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""We can only hope...that such a sweet deal's really true."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Let's open it, Nee-san."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Right. I'm opening it."" "
,The heavy door...opened slowly... 
,"Then, the gold-filled underground VIP room showed itself... "
,They only had an instant to admire its splendid furnishings. 
,"As soon as the mountain of gold next to the canopy bed came into sight, they all froze, stunned. "
,"After a second, the stunned silence faded and was replaced by cries of astonishment and wild joy... "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Incredible!! Haha, hahhahahahahahaha!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I-I can't believe it... It's 20 billion yen in gold...!! It really...does exist!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""What a shining mountain. It almost blinds the eyes..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Uhhahahahahahahaha!! We did it! We did it!! We win this game!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Y-You mustn't touch it without permission! This is Father's gold!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Oh, really?! Then why don't you call Father down here now! Right away!! The time for your farce is over and done with!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Natsuhi nee-san, let's put an end to the obvious lies, shall we? We have a real mountain of gold right here! Shouldn't we all be honest with each other?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Fortunately, we're all in a good mood and feeling very gracious now. Just give it up already!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Nng...!"" "
,A pile of gold this massive carries magical power within it. That power draws out the most honest feelings within people. 
,"The light from the chandelier glinted off the golden mountain, lighting them up with its golden sparkle. "
,It was as though the sparkle controlled everyone present. 
,"For some time, they forgot their age... and howled and laughed, running about and rolling around like a bunch of excited kindergartners at a park... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...What is all this? What's it supposed to mean?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Before the crimes, ...the epitaph has been solved, ...and by all of the siblings together..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That hasn't happened in any of the games before now."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Supposedly, {f:5:Beatrice} decided not to commit the crime if the epitaph was solved..."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah, supposedly. ...Hmph. We'll see about that."" "
,"Ange snorted, ...but I believed. "
,...This is what Clair decided. 
,"Because she entrusted everything to the roulette of fate, she'll obey the result. "
,"She let the roulette decide her own fate specifically because ""they"" couldn't decide on their own. "
,"So, she'll do what it says. She'll follow her own rule. "
,She'll definitely keep her promise. 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I don't think the crime will occur."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Are you sure about that?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Yes. ...Her roulette has already made its decision. This is the end of her game."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""If it's the end, what happens next? Do they all become happy rich people and leave the family conference unharmed? Does my family get an ingot that isn't chocolate as a parting gift before coming back to me? Will it be a happy end for everyone? You think those witches would chain us to chairs to show us a naive dream like that?!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Nnn..."" "
,"When she showed off the chain on her wrist with a clank, I was unable to counter her with confidence. "
,But I want to believe. 
,"Though this might be the least exciting ending, Clair's game has now reached an end. "
,"...Perhaps, just once at the end, she wanted to show us a world where no crime occurs. "
,"Now that she has disappeared with no regrets, is she leaving us a parting gift in the form of a game where no crime takes place, in a sense, the most peaceful sort of game? "
,I want to believe. 
,"...If only these heavy, cold chains weren't holding us in place in this theater. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I-Is someone there?!?!"" "
,Rosa's shrill cry brought the celebrating to an immediate stop. 
,Rosa knew she'd seen it. 
,"The curtain against the wall had fluttered, and a shadow had been there behind it. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...C'mon, don't do that. You're just imagining things..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Is someone there?! If you are, come out...!"" "
,"When Eva yelled, ...the curtain shook. "
,"And then, ...a witch wearing a black dress appeared from the other side... "
,"In an instant, everyone realized that the dress was the same as the one worn by the witch of the portrait, ...and they realized one more thing. "
,This person...was the owner of this room. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Welcome to the room of the gold."" "
,"Her face and her voice were expressionless, blank. "
,"The others all looked at each other, wondering who should respond. Rudolf was the first to speak. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...So, you are {f:5:Beatrice}."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""A-And you're the one who gave Maria that letter...?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Is Father behind this?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No. This is my...game."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If that's so, then we've won. We've solved the epitaph's riddle and found the gold...!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""We've accepted your challenge and won...! That means this gold belongs to us, right?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed, it is as you say. ...You have solved the epitaph splendidly and discovered the hidden gold. This game ends in your victory. ...This gold no longer belongs to me, but to all of you..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...It seems you're a graceful loser."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Hey, you. ...If we hadn't solved the epitaph's riddle, what were you planning to do?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""The letter said that you'd take ""everything of the Ushiromiya family""."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. I planned to take all of your wealth...and all of your lives. ...I planned to do as I pleased with everything that exists on this island."" "
,...The witch walked towards the table next to the bed. 
,"Then, for the first time, the others realized what sat on that table. "
,They were...four rifles. There was also a case filled with bullets... 
,"The witch picked up one of the lead bullets lying on the table and played with it, her face still expressionless, as she spoke. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If this night ended before you managed to solve the epitaph's riddle, ...I planned to follow the epitaph and commit 13 murders."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Wh-What did you say...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...That's what I thought when I first saw that epitaph. ...It almost looks like something you'd find in a serial murder mystery novel. ...That's right. If you had killed 13 people to match the epitaph, ...that would've made for quite a mysterious crime..."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Th-There's no way you could do that all by yourself...! No matter how many guns you had, killing 13 people...that would just be...!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...I formed my plan with great care and constructed several alternatives. I envisioned all of the actions you might take from tonight and through tomorrow... and prepared a mystery to deal with each of those. ......I'm afraid I cannot reveal those at this point, but it really was a tightly-knit set of pleasant closed room murders."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""If there were just a few of us, you probably could've gunned us down in our sleep. But there's no way you could've killed 13 of us...! We aren't that stupid."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......It would seem so. At any rate, I predicted that the epitaph being solved before the first twilight was the most unlikely result."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""It would seem that us reaching this place was a miscalculation on your part."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No. ...Even this was one of the results of the roulette I wished to create. This is probably the best outcome for all of you. No one will die, and you can leave this island with the gold. ...Congratulations. This game ends with a perfect victory for you all."" "
,"If no one could solve the riddle, she planned to take a gun and commit a serial murder. Everyone gulped as they watched the witch emotionlessly make her confession... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...If this confession of yours is the truth, that means you were trying to kill us."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. That is true."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""The hell... How can you just say it like that?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""You couldn't possibly expect us to treat you favorably after revealing that much to us, right...?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I am prepared. ......You may do as you will with me. ...If you hadn't solved the epitaph, I would have done the same to you, so it is only fair."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...This girl's got guts."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I planned this game because I was prepared to bet my life. I am satisfied with the result. ...If you wish to kill me now, I am prepared."" "
,"By now, she didn't even treasure her life. "
,"As the witch spoke and walked near the others, they automatically stepped back... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The gold belongs to all of you. I planned to give everything to the one who discovered it first, but I didn't expect there to be seven of you. ...I leave the decision of how to split the gold to you. I will not involve myself. ...And..."" "
,The witch walked even closer. 
,"The group parted, and she walked up to the antique clock behind them. "
,The clock was large and had a dignified feel to it. The witch patted it and spoke. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Allow me to explain the device within this clock. ...For you have gained not just the gold, but the entirety of this island."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""What...do you mean by that?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...... If you read it like a murder case up until the eighth twilight, then only 13 people are killed. But by the ninth twilight, ...it clearly says that none are to be left alive."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""What does that mean? That she...was planning to massacre all of us?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Don't tell me, that clock..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""As you have guessed, ...it is linked to a set of explosives."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Are you the one who set that up? ...Or was that Ushiromiya Kinzo?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kinzo is the one who set up the device. It's the source of his mad magical power..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...I-I don't have a clue what you're talkin' about."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""In other words, ...Dad set up this bomb, and if he ever went broke, he was prepared to die in a blast that would wipe away everything including himself......?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""On this island, Ushiromiya Kinzo made a contract with the Golden Witch and obtained the gold. However, that was not all he gained."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Wh-What are you talking about...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wait, ...don't tell me... ........."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""There is that rumor about the remains of an old Japanese military base existing on Rokkenjima... Could it be..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Your guess is correct. ...Beneath this island sleep the remains of an underground Japanese military base from the time of the war. Along with 900 tons of explosives."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...N-Nine hundred tons?! Th-That's unbelievable! If that exploded, the result would be unimaginable! Forget just the mansion blowin' up, ...it'd leave a massive crater!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I believe an expert's estimate put it at a hole several dozen meters deep and a kilometer across."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...There wouldn't be...even a trace left..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Those explosives can be ignited by a special device. ...One connected to the activation switch I just flipped."" "
,The witch toyed with a switch on the top part of the antique clock. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...If 24:00 arrives when the switch is in this position, the bombs will explode."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""U-Umm, it's almost 24:00 now..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""In other words, it won't explode X hours after you flip it. ...It's a time limit bomb that only explodes at midnight. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. ...It is almost 24:00 now. If such an explosion is what you desire, you need only leave it like this."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Who would want that...?!! Turn it off!"" "
,"By this time, Kinzo was probably the only one who knew. "
,The secret base on Rokkenjima had started out as a submarine base. 
,"However, when that plan reached a standstill, it was redefined as a top secret base for homeland defense. "
,A huge plan had been drawn up to have the army and navy perform a pincer attack on American forces if the latter decided to land on Kujuukuri Beach and press towards Tokyo. 
,"As a trump card for this massive defensive maneuver, the navy started stockpiling large quantities of explosives and fuel in absolute secrecy. "
,And the Rokkenjima base was the location of that top-secret stockpile. 
,The buried explosives weighed 900 tons in total. 
,"Also, fearing that the Americans might find out the island's secrets and seize the explosives, they set up a system for the self-destruction of the entire island... "
,"Kinzo, who knew all of this, decided not to remove this device, but to tie it in with this strange clock that could trigger such an explosion any night at midnight. "
,"...Kinzo was famous for building up his funds using a vast store of gold, then using those funds in several sink-or-swim gambles, one after another. "
,Just what did his stockpile of gold...and the 900 tons of sleeping explosives mean to him? 
,"At this point, we can only guess. Perhaps the true source of Kinzo's mad power...wasn't the gold after all. "
,"If he lost a big gamble and all that he owned, he could erase this entire island from existence with this device. "
,"For the rest of his life, he must have put the gold and everything else he had on the line... "
,"Kinzo probably stared at this clock at times, ...sometimes flipping the activation switch and letting it tick down. "
,"Maybe, whenever he came up against a troubling problem, he would hide in here...and flip the switch... "
,...With the intention of blowing everything away if he didn't think of a brilliant plan before 24:00 came. 
,"He could gaze at this mountain of gold, listening to the clock tick towards his death as he searched for an idea... "
,"Perhaps Ushiromiya Kinzo's real study wasn't the one in the mansion, but this place instead... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...That sort of switch sounds just like Dad. ...So, maybe each time Dad worried about something, all of us kids were put on the line as well..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""This is Father, ...so it wouldn't be unthinkable..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""This device now belongs to all of you. ...If you desire a massive explosion, use it whenever you please."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""A-Are you crazy...?! Who'd want a big explosion...?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...These explosives are half a century old, right? Would they really go off?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes, of course. The explosives and the fuses are still working. ...I tested them myself."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""You tested them...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...You mean...that?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I see... Now I finally understand. So, that's why the shrine disappeared without a trace..."" "
,"That summer, the shrine had disappeared completely, along with the reef under it. "
,"Though people found it odd that the waves could have wiped it out so completely, no one paid it much mind. "
,"And now, this piece fits perfectly into the hole that caused that strange feeling... "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. ......I used that shrine to test whether the explosives were still working after half a century. I believe you are all aware of the result."" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""............"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The little bit I used was enough to make that entire reef vanish. It's easy to see how 900 tons of that would cause an explosion large enough to rewrite the map..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...If an explosion like that were to occur, it would certainly kill all of us. But what about you? I doubt you were planning to commit a group suicide with us..."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""This underground VIP room is connected by a subterranean passage to the remnants of the military base. If you go straight along that, you'll come out at the hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island, Kuwadorian. It's about two kilometers away. If you make it all the way there, you should be able to escape the blast."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I see. So, you planned to escape to there just before the blast."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I have only said that such a thing is possible. ...You may not believe this, but if the ninth twilight ended before any of you could solve the riddle, ...I planned to die along with everything else."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...There's something seriously wrong with this girl..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""She's insane... There's no point overthinking it! If we hadn't solved the epitaph, she would've used those guns, or else that switch, to massacre all of us, right?! There's no doubting that now!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You are correct. ...You have ended this game in the best possible way, without there being even a single victim. ...I wish to convey my respect and admiration. There may have been seven of you, but you did solve that riddle, which took me so long to solve, in a single night. ...That is worthy of praise."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""And I admire you for your graciousness and honesty in defeat. ......We'll decide how to deal with you in the future, but I intend to do all I can to reach a gentlemanly agreement."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Pay me no mind any longer. I am already one of the dead, who was already prepared to kill everyone and die myself."" "
,"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} solved the epitaph, reached this room, and revived. "
,"And now, ...new people had solved the riddle and reached this room, ...so her role was finished. "
,"When the epitaph's riddle was solved, ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s illusion of the witch ended. "
,"Most likely, no one in this room was capable of understanding her grim determination. "
,...She herself was probably the only one who understood. 
,"As long as the many selves inside of her understood, that was enough. "
,......I am one yet many. 
,I abandoned myself to the magical roulette of endless possibilities. The result...the answer...is this. This is what the tarot cards known as the epitaph ceremony have shown me. 
,...{f:5:Beatrice} is already dead. 
,"They did not kill her. I killed her myself, ...in accordance with fate's command. They will never understand, ...for all eternity. "
,............ 
,"The witch stared up at the ceiling without speaking for a while, then looked as though she'd suddenly remembered something. "
,She grabbed at the sleeves of her dress and took out some sort of card. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh, yes. I forgot. ...I have no need for money after death. I will give this to all of you as well."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...A cash card?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I have converted a portion of the gold to cash. This is for the account that the money is in."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""I see. So this is source of the Golden Witch's magical energy."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""How much?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I've forgotten the details. However, there is more than a billion yen."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""A billion...! Now that really would be magic!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""True. There's nothing you couldn't do with that much money."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Very true. The strongest magic to counter the Humans' anti-magic toxin is this magic of gold. ...It may be that this card holds greater power than the ingots."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Certainly. Cash would be much more agreeable than ingots."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Here you go. ......I have no need of this anymore."" "
,The card she held out...was not taken by any of them. 
,Who would ever just hand over a card with a billion yen in it? 
,"The mountain of gold, the device for blowing up the island, the card with a billion yen... ...All of these surpassed their understanding. "
,"So, ...no one could bring themselves to take it. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I don't like it."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...What don't you like?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Here you go, here's a mountain of gold. And I'll turn off the explosives and give you a card worth a billion yen while we're at it. ...It sounds far too good to be true. ...You're trying to trick us somehow, aren't you?"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I have no desire to trick you, but I won't try and force you to believe. ...I have offered you everything, revealed everything. What you believe and what you do is now for you, the new masters of the gold, to decide. You are even free to disbelieve all I say and leave this place."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Eva, I can't imagine that she's lying."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And how could you know that?! I don't like how relaxed she's acting! It's as though she thinks she's already won! ...I just had an idea, a second ago!! What if she's lying about which is the ""off"" side of the switch?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Wh-What do you mean, Nee-san...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Just a second ago, this woman flipped the switch to the side she said would turn off the bomb! But what if that actually armed the bomb?! We solved the riddle, so you turned the bomb's switch to ""on"", trying to blow us and everything else up, right?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...... ...If that is what you think, then feel free to flip the switch on this clock. It will be 24:00 in one minute. ...The clock will show you the truth."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Wh-What did you say...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""H-Hey, what're we supposed to do...? Is the bomb set to ""on"" now? Or ""off""?!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I can't imagine that she's lying...! It's inactive now. We shouldn't flip it...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But I don't like it!! Why is she so resigned to her fate?! Why's she offering us things one after another?! She's tricking us to buy time!! She wants to buy time until 24:00 so that she can go down in flames along with us!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Wh-What about the switch itself? Is there some way to tell if it's on or off...?"" "
,On the upper part of the antique clock was a metal switch that could slide right or left. 
,"Right now, it was set to the left. "
,"However, there were no marks in particular on either side to tell one which was ""off"" and which was ""on"". "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Hey, tell us the truth!! Which way is off?!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Left. It's off now."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You idiot! You really expect an honest answer from her?! It's the opposite... It has to be!! The right side must be ""off""!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""W-We don't have any more time, Nee-san...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Quit it, Eva!! Don't touch the switch! It's set to ""off"" now!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Eva-san, take your hand off it!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I agree. It's ""off"" now. If she wanted to kill us with a bomb, she wouldn't have told us about it."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........!!! ...B-{f:5:Beatriiiiiiiice}...!! Don't think you can trick me...!!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...... ...5. ...4...3."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nng, aah...aaaaaaaaaarrrrgggghh!!!"" "
,The second hand of the clock...ticked past 24:00. 
,"October 4th ended...and the curtain rose on October 5th, 1986... "
,The switch was still pointing to the left. ...The witch's words had been proven correct. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Have I gained your trust now...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Y-You bitch!"" "
,"With a hideous, sweat-covered expression, Eva snatched the cash card away from the witch's hand. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...How about a bankbook and seal? We can't withdraw anything with just a card!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""All you need is the PIN. It's eight digits long."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""W-Wait a second!! I'm writing it down...!!"" "
,Eva and Kyrie both took out a pen and notepad and began writing the eight digit number the witch told them. 
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......That is everything I have to tell you and to give you. ...I will say nothing more. All of my tasks have been completed."" "
,"After saying this, the witch spun around...and sat down on the bed. "
,She wasn't even looking at the others anymore. 
,"She sat there like an empty husk which had, just as she had said, finished everything it existed to do... "
,"For a while, everyone watched the witch to see if she would remember something else and start talking. "
,"However, she said nothing else. "
,The witch who had called herself one of the dead was now little more than a large French doll wearing a black dress... 
,"Gold is the only physical embodiment of magic that can exist in the human world. Since ancient times, even a small bit of it could control men with its magic. "
,"In that case, how much magic power would dwell in it... if it was piled up in a mountain so high you'd have to look up to see the top? "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Don't be stupid, we'll split it evenly! Isn't that the obvious solution?!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Didn't we say that half of this pile would belong to me, and the other half would be split between the four of us?!"" "
,"The yells of the humans dancing around the gold reverberated throughout the underground room... In front of the pile of gold, they were arguing about how it should be split. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Did you solve the riddle all by yourself, Nii-san? You didn't, right?! The four of us siblings solved it together! Of course we'll split it in four equal parts!!"" "
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Coward! Weren't you the ones who first made that proposal about the gold's distribution?!! How can you disregard that so easily...?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You really think you're in a position to bargain? When you're the ones hiding Dad's death...?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Y-Yeah, yeah...!! You've been swindling us this whole time, treating Father's wealth as if it were your own...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""All you need to do is split the gold evenly, and we'll drop all the rest, including that particular issue. It sounds very fair to me."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Well, if you insist, go ahead and try splitting it four ways. Let's divide this pile up right now, and you can all take your own shares home. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"I hope you have pockets that can hold 2.5 tons of ingots...! It seems you've all been driven mad by the gold and lost all ability to make rational judgements."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""What do you mean by that, Krauss nii-san?"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Look at this ingot. As you can see, there are no official markings, just Father's crest. ...How do you intend to turn unmarked gold like this into cash?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Nnng, ...well..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Have you finally figured it out? This pile of gold may be worth 20 billion yen. However, that's only if you can trade it for cash. Are any of you capable of exchanging this many unmarked, unidentified ingots for cash at the proper rates?!"" "
,"If it was a necklace or a ring, exchanging it for cash would have been a manageable problem. "
,"However, doing that for several tons of unmarked gold that couldn't be made public...would be impossible for any normal person. "
,"...However, Krauss could do it. "
,"Among the several business friends that remained from Kinzo's generation, there were some who had black market ties and a lot of financial power. "
,The billion yen tied to the cash card that the Golden Witch had held out a second ago... had already been turned to cash thanks to one of Kinzo's connections... 
,"However, none of the other siblings had any connections like that. "
,They would have to rely on Krauss to get cash for the gold. 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Now you're finally seeing it. I apologize for hiding all of those things about Father. However, you're in no position to take advantage of that weakness."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Y-You really think you have such an advantage just because of something like that?!?!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""What do you intend to do with that gun? Please, you're scaring us."" "
,Eva was gripping the gun so hard it looked like it might snap. 
,...The four guns that the witch had placed in this room were now in the hands of the relatives. 
,"Just as the gold had led their hearts astray, it seemed these guns had the magical power to turn their hearts to violence... "
,"Finally, a scuffle arose between Eva and Krauss. "
,"Off to the side, Natsuhi started arguing with Rudolf and his wife, and the grand underground VIP room was filled with thundering jeers... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"" "
,"After being forced to watch this scene for so long, Ange's face was starting to contort with pain. "
,"It was only natural, after being shown this abusive argument between her parents and her other relatives. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...What on earth......?"" "
,"It was painful for Lion too. Lion would have tried to intervene and calm them, if that had been possible. "
,"The gold isn't going anywhere, right? If you just slow down and think, you'll be able to resolve this. "
,"Going by what Eva and the others said, it's clear that'll they need a lot of money before the end of the year. "
,"However, the billion yen cash card should be more than enough to pay for that. "
,"That would handle their emergency expenses, so they could then convert the gold to cash at their leisure...and just split it amongst themselves. "
,"Sure, maybe Krauss was the only one capable of converting the gold. That might give him an advantage over the other siblings. "
,"However, this gold couldn't be dealt with by open means. In addition to attracting public attention, it would also lead to various legal problems. "
,It was better for this secret money to remain secret. 
,"If they wanted to get the largest portions possible, then they should all agree not to tell anyone about this gold. "
,"In other words, to maximize their profits, they would all need to make a gentleman's agreement...to keep this secret. "
,"Krauss did have a slight advantage. However, it was possible for the other relatives to refuse to cooperate and tell the world about the gold. "
,"And then, ...there was also the concealment of Kinzo's death to consider. "
,"Krauss was an investor. He needed not only financial clout, but also a certain degree of public confidence in him. "
,His advantage isn't big enough for him to act so overbearing. 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...The mountain of gold...has made everyone lose their ability to think rationally. ...This isn't an argument between adults. ...It's just a fight between kids."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What's so fun about showing us this...? Or is this the game of some new witch...? Are they watching us suffer from somewhere and laughing?!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""............"" "
,"By now, ...even I didn't have a clue who was showing this to us, or for what reason. "
,"At the very least, this new tale didn't seem to be overflowing with affection. "
,"...At first, I thought it was a tale of a beautiful world, where no crime occurred and Clair's regrets had vanished. "
,But something's different. 
,This tale is clearly filled with ill will towards us. 
,"I'm sure of that much now, ...but I don't have a clue who would want to show us this. "
,"Suddenly, an explosion rang out. "
,...I didn't think it was the sound of gunfire. 
,"After all, ...people living a normal life never hear that kind of sound. "
,"*drip*, *drip*drip*drip*. It was the sound of thick raindrops hitting the floor. "
,...There was no rain in this underground room. 
,...It was blood dripping down...from Natsuhi's right eye. 
,The bullet had gone in through her right eye...towards the back of her head... 
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...N-Natsuhi...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I-It's your fault...for jumping at me..."" "
,"The gun, ...which fell from Eva's grasp, ...landed on the floor with a hard metallic clang. "
,"As though in response to that sound, Natsuhi's head slowly turned to face the ceiling... "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...N-Natsuhi... ...Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"" "
,Natsuhi flopped backwards. 
,"When the back of her head hit the floor, a red splash spread out beneath it, ...forming a single flower to adorn her dead face... "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Natsuhi...nee-san..."" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Wh-Why did you shoot her?! Why? Eva?! Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!"" "
,"Krauss howled, raised his gun, and ran at Eva. "
,"At the same time, Hideyoshi leapt between them. A scuffle broke out between the two men. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""How could you?! Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii, nngaaaaaahhhhh!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""K-Krauss nii-san, you've got it wrong... You've got it all wrong... It was...just an accident...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Evaaaaaaaaaa, how could you?!! I'll kill you! I'll kill yooooooouuu!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I......I didn't shoot... I didn't... Even though I told her to stop, she just jumped at me...!!"" "
,"Krauss, who had just seen his wife killed before his eyes, had lost all traces of rationality in his expression. "
,"He was so furious that, if he had knocked Hideyoshi aside and jumped at Eva, he might have torn her throat out. "
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Why did you kill her?! Why?! Evaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""It was an accident, ...an accident...!! Calm down, Krauss nii-san...!! ...Owowowow......nngggggghhhh..."" "
,Another explosion rang out. Hideyoshi's face was covered with blood. 
,"The two of them had been fighting over the gun Krauss held, trying to push it away from themselves. "
,"When the barrel had turned to point at Krauss's chin, ...the sneering, formless reaper, master of the room of gold, had swung its scythe once more. "
,A line of blood...trickled from Krauss's mouth. 
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""U...Uwaaaaahhhh, ...hyaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"" "
,"The two fell down, with Krauss's body on top of Hideyoshi. "
,"Letting out a cowardly cry, Hideyoshi backed away before Krauss's body could cover him... "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...D-Dear...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""I didn't do anything!! Krauss nii-san's finger just got caught on the trigger...! It's an accident, ...an accident I tell you...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Th-That's right, an accident... This was all an accident...!!"" "
,"As the pair of them broke down sobbing and repeatedly claiming that it was all an accident, Rosa and the others were unable to say a thing... "
,"The witch also watched this scene, but said nothing, and appeared to be completely disinterested. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...I-It wasn't our fault...! It was just an accident...! You saw, right?! Right? Right?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You saw that, didn't you, Rosa?! Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san both let their emotions get ahold of them and charged at us...!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Who knows? I couldn't say either way."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Stupid Rosa!! You saw, didn't you?! You saw it from right there, so you must know!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I'm sorry. I can't tell if it happened by accident...or if you killed them and tried to make it look like an accident."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""R-Rosa, you...!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Rudolf-kun...! You saw! You know what happened, right?! Right?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...... ...Sorry, but I agree with Rosa. We can't tell if it was an accident or intentional."" "
,Rosa's and Rudolf's gazes looked very cold and indifferent to Eva and her husband. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What are we going to do? They were shot to death...! Saying it was a simple accident won't convince anyone...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Th-The forest! We'll say they went to the forest and went missing! That will buy us some time...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That won't get us off the hook, right?! The police will just search the whole forest!! And anyway, why would those two go off into an uncultivated forest like that?! It'll look suspicious from the start! There's no way we'll get away with it!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""It'll be okay...! If we hide the corpses here, no one will be able to find them! If we all play dumb, it'll work!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""It won't... There's no way you can fool the police. If the two of them disappear during a family conference where we were arguing over the inheritance problem, ...the police won't just put it down as a case of missing persons."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...... ...I-I just had an idea..."" "
,"Though Eva had been scratching at her head, overcome with emotion, ...her arms suddenly fell as though their strings had been cut. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...Wh-What did you think of?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...An accident. ...We just need to make it look like an accident."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Idiot...! What kind of accident...?! There are clear gunshot wounds on both corpses, right?! Even if we burn them to make it look like they were caught in a fire, it'll still be obvious that they were killed by guns!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...A fire? That's not good enough. ...We need more. A much more massive accident."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...A-A massive accident...?"" "
,"Eva slowly walked forward, ...tapped it, and spoke. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""An explosion accident. ...We just need the sort of accident that will leave no traces of their corpses."" "
,"As she played with the switch that would cause an automatic explosion at 24:00, ...Eva spun around to look at them, a crazed expression on her face... "
,It was truly...a mad flash of inspiration. 
,"If they flipped the switch to the right and waited for 24:00, the 900 tons of explosives would wipe out the mansion without a trace. "
,There wouldn't even be anything left of the corpses. There certainly wouldn't be any way to tell that they had died by gunshot wounds before the explosion. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's an unshakable fact that this island is still filled with explosives from the war! Then, by coincidence, tomorrow night...something will set it off by chance and the whole thing will explode!! Yes, it'll be an accident! An explosion accident!! What do you say?!! There's no way the police will find out the truth!! This way, we can pull it off!! We can hide the manner of their deaths!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Ha...hahaha... That's...crazy..."" "
,"Shaking, Hideyoshi frantically searched for a counterargument, hoping to shut down Eva's mad idea. "
,......But he couldn't find one. 
,"If they blew everything up, the facts would all be muddled... They could make it look as though Krauss and Natsuhi had died in an explosion accident...! "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's perfect, just perfect...!!! After all, it was an accident that they died anyway! We're just changing the type of accident!! Isn't that right? We can think up any story we want!! By chance, the rest of us will happen to be in the hidden mansion tomorrow night! Then, when the explosion accident occurs, we'll be lucky enough to survive!! That story should work!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...J-Just what sort of story are you planning on? ...What kind of story could explain how the two of them alone remained here while the rest of us conveniently went to the hidden mansion and managed to escape...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's what we've got to think up now, stupid Rosa!!! It doesn't matter what it is, as long as we all agree to it!! I'll think of something... I {i:am} thinking... You all think too!! Someone think of somethiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""C-Calm down, Eva... I'll think about it, and so will everyone else! We'll definitely think of something, and it'll all work out! We'll share the burden. You won't have to carry it all yourself...!! It'll all be okay... It will!! I know we'll think of a good excuse!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...What kind of excuse? We took the kids and all the servants to go exploring an underground passageway, leaving just the two of them behind, and the rest of us all decided to spend the night in the hidden mansion? How could any excuse work? ...It's insane!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And thinking up that insane thing is our job!! Why are you acting like this has nothing to do with you?! You think of something too!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Nee-san, let me ask you a question. ...If you blow up the island, what will happen to this gold?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nnng, ...w-well......"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""We've finally gotten our hands on 20 billion yen of gold. And you want to blow it all away...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We can just carry it away...yeah, that's right!! The explosion will happen tomorrow at midnight! We have a full day!! If we all carry it together, we might-"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""You realize there's 10 tons of it, right? ...Just how much do you think our small group can carry back and forth across this long, underground passage that goes all the way across the island? You're being absurd."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""H-Here!! We have this card, right?! The card worth a billion yen, the one that woman gave us!! We'll just carry as much gold as we can! We have the card with a billion yen on top of that! If we split that three ways, we'll have more than 300 million each! That should be enough for all of our purposes!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I don't like it."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Y-You don't like what...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""We have a mountain worth 20 billion yen right here. Why should we be satisfied with just 300 million each?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...R-Rosaaaaa..."" "
,Eva's face twisted in anguish...and was met by Rosa's look of cold unconcern. 
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...If we gave Krauss nii-san his share, we'd each have a share of 5 billion. Subtract the 300 million from the card, and the rest of my share is 4.7 billion. ...If you agree to pay that much to me, then you can do whatever you want with this mountain of gold."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What do you think you're saying?! So, you don't intend to cooperate?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Nee-san, please calm down and listen. This plan will let both of us leave with the maximum amount of money."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wh-What...?!?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I want you to go to the police and turn yourself in, admitting that you got into a scuffle and the gun went off."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""A-Are you crazy?! I don't want to go to the police!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Of course, we don't want to say that the crime happened here. The police would find the gold. ...Yes, how about the rose garden? It's pouring rain now, so the police probably won't find any contradictions at the crime scene."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I'll let you think of an excuse for why you and Nii-san started fighting while you were holding guns in the rainy rose garden. ...Please, don't try to get us and our shares involved just because you want to hide your own crime."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""R-Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""It's not so bad, right? After all, it's not like they'll keep you in jail for several decades. It was an accident, right? You'll be able to get out after just a few years. ...When you've paid for your sins and come back, then you can do whatever you want with your 5 billion."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""No, I'd never do that!! What would happen if we were arrested?! What would happen to my husband's company?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Who cares about the company? With 5 billion yen, working any longer would just be a waste of time, right?"" "
,Rosa had never intended to go along with Eva's proposal. 
,"If it was a question of maximizing each person's portion, no one had anything to gain from an explosion accident. "
,An explosion would conceal Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths. ...And it would serve no further purpose. 
,"From Rosa's perspective, the ideal outcome would be for them to confess to their crimes, without any unnecessary tricks. "
,All she wanted was to change the crime scene from here to a different place. 
,"However, Eva didn't want to be arrested. "
,"She didn't like having her share shrink from 5 billion to 300 million, but even that was more than enough to cover the amount she had been trying to wring out of Krauss in the first place. "
,"She wanted to hide what had happened here, even if it meant blowing away 4.7 billion yen. "
,What would happen if they were arrested? 
,"The life, the company and the trust that Eva had worked so long to build...were things that couldn't be bought back with money. "
,"So, she wanted to hide Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths, even if it meant blowing up all 4.7 billion yen worth of her gold...! "
,"But from Rosa's perspective, that was just irrational nonsense. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""R-Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""What do you think you're doing with that gun, Nee-san? ...Are you going to have me die in the explosion too? That'll make finding an excuse even harder. In fact, it'll make it harder to explain away the other two deaths as accidents too..."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Three whole deaths means it'll be quite a large-scale crime. ...It would probably get you the death penalty. Or life in prison, if you're lucky. Even in the best case, you'll probably be put away for more than a decade, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Turn yourself in. If you do, this will be no more than a pair of unfortunate accidents. Of course, your jail term won't be too terrible either. ...Don't worry about George-kun. We'll take good care of him. And we'll make sure that your entire share of 5 billion yen is waiting for you when you get back."" "
,Eva ground her teeth and glared. 
,"The Rosa she knew should've been shaking and obeying her commands. And yet, ...Rosa wasn't scared. "
,"Her blank expression... no, that faint smile...was one that Eva had never seen before. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Put the gun down, Nee-san. Once you calm down, you'll see that my plan is the best one. ...Jail isn't so bad, right? Think of it as a financial strategy."" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Even if they put you in for ten years, there will be 5 billion waiting for you when you get out. That's like working for a 500 million yen salary, right? If you think of it that way, won't you enjoy your job more?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Liar!!! You just want to steal my share away while I'm in there!! Like your man did to you!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""H-He has nothing to do with this, okay?!?! I won't run away... I'd never run away with someone's money... ...Ooohhh, ...I'll never do iiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"" "
,"Rosa's once-frigid face was filled with rage. The two howling people pointed their guns at each other, shouting insults... "
,You could smell the gold room's reaper slinking closer. 
,"The smell of gunpowder, the explosive smell of death, ...filled the room... "
,*drip*. 
,A bubble of blood dripped from Rosa's mouth. 
,"Then, ...she fell over lifelessly, like a mannequin someone had pushed over. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...E-Eva...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I-It wasn't me! I swear I didn't even pull the trigger!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......The round in the chamber of your gun was spent when you fired at Natsuhi-san, right...? You never reloaded, so even if you pull the trigger, that gun won't kill anyone. Have no fear."" "
,"As Kyrie said this, she maneuvered the lever action with a practiced hand, and a smoke-smelling shell casing was ejected... "
,"It hit the floor with a small, metallic sound. That tiny sound had a disturbing ring to it... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Rosa-san's analysis was a little naive. ...She has no idea how difficult it would be to exchange this many unmarked gold ingots for money."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Back in Dad's day, even just showing this gold to get funding was enough to create the massive rumor called the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold. ...Exchanging this for cash is impossible. A pile of gold you can't use is no better than a pile of crap."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""""10 tons of gold were exchanged for cash on the black market, and the Successor and his wife died mysterious deaths."" Expecting that to go unnoticed is what's really unbelievable. ...We don't want to get the police involved. We'll blow up this island and destroy all the evidence. If it's tough parting with the gold, feel free to grab as much as you can hold. The billion yen on the cash card is more than enough. ...In other words, Eva nee-san was right."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I......I'm glad... ...It looks like we're on the same page... ...I-If the police get involved, who knows what might happen? It's the same with cashing in the gold. I'm sure that would have tripped us up somewhere, so we had no choice...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The 1 billion that woman over there exchanged for cash is the only money we'll be able to get our hands on! And even splitting that billion, it'll be more than enough for what we need...! On top of that, now that Rosa is dead, our shares have increased even more...! We can each leave this island with 500 million...!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Exactly. As long as we don't let our greedy desire to cash in the gold control us, ...we can pretend that everything that occurred on this island never happened. We have a way to do that right here."" "
,"By this point, neither deaths from accidental discharges nor shooting murders meant anything on this island. "
,Everything would be erased equally by the explosion accident. 
,"No matter what happened between now and midnight the next day, everything would be rewritten. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...And you told me...to turn myself in?! Stupid Rosa...! You weren't satisfied with just 300 million? This is what you get for being too greedy... ...Y-You brought this upon yourself..."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""But Kyrie-san, ...there was no need to shoot her, right...? Even Rosa-san would've figured it out if you'd just told her..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I did need to shoot her. After all, Rosa-san's the only one who didn't fire her gun."" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...What does that matter...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""The guns lying at your feet are Krauss nii-san's and Eva nee-san's. Both of those have been fired. However, Rosa-san's gun can shoot if you just pull the trigger. It's hard to reload one of these if you aren't used to a lever action. An amateur would have some trouble pulling it off."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Kyrie-san, what are you talking about...?"" "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Y-You...!!"" "
,They finally realized what Kyrie meant. 
,"""Rosa had the only gun that could still fire, so I shot her first."" "
,"Oh, how foolish we were... Why didn't we realize sooner? "
,Even though we knew there's a mechanism for erasing everything that happens on this island... 
,Eva and Hideyoshi hurried to pick up the guns that lay at their feet. 
,"At the same time, fire spat from Kyrie's gun once more. "
,"Hideyoshi let out a short scream, clutched at his chest, and fell over face-down. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Dear?! Dear...!! "
Ushiromiya Eva,"...Wah, ...why is this-"" "
,"Eva fiddled with the lever action, trying to imitate something she vaguely remembered from a western movie, but something seemed to be caught, and the still-open lever didn't budge. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""See? It's pretty hard."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Y-You...!!!"" "
,Kyrie finished reloading with a fluid motion. The way she held it was as innocent and sure as a kid playing with a squirt gun. 
,"With another heartless cry of gunfire, the puppet called Eva slumped down to the floor as though its strings had been cut... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Rudolf-san, the billion yen card."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sure..."" "
,"The cash card with a billion yen, which Eva had just grabbed from the witch... "
,That alone was worth more than enough. 
,The 20 billion yen pile of gold had skewed everyone's sense of value. 
,Just a few million yen is enough for people to kill over. And this was a billion yen. 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Rosa-san, those were some famous last words there. ""Just 300 million?"" ...You were too greedy."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Heheh... No kidding. ...Ah, lucky me. I don't have to fish through her corpse."" "
,"As Rudolf walked up to Eva's body, he found the card lying beside it...and picked it up. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""So, this flimsy little card is worth a billion yen... ...Sticking with the company would be a waste of time. So, do we close up shop and spend the rest of our lives in some southern country?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I'm sure you'd get bored right away. Besides, I like seeing you get all worried about some problem, then leap around like a little kid when you finally overcome it."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Heheheh...! Sure you do..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Thank you, Ms. Golden Witch. ...Rudolf-san and I will make good use of this billion."" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Krauss nii-san promised to treat you in a gentlemanly fashion. But I haven't made any such promise."" "
,...She pulled the trigger without a trace of mercy. 
,"When the ringing of the gunfire died down, ...blood trickled from the witch's mouth, and she fell over onto the bed. "
,"Once again, Kyrie ejected the used shell casing. "
,The four metal sounds of used shells hitting the floor seemed to symbolize the fact that Rudolf and his wife now possessed all shares of the gold... 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...All of them were really slow-witted... ...From the moment they heard about the bomb, they should've known that they wouldn't be leaving this island as a big, happy family."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sorry 'bout this, Aniki, Aneki, Rosa. ...Well, that's life for you. Give me a break, okay? Aniki and Aneki get into a fight, Rosa gets dragged in, and I'm the one who picks up the pieces. ...Just like it's always been, right?"" "
,It wasn't as though Rudolf and Kyrie had planned to kill everyone and take everything for themselves from the start. 
,"Kyrie had quickly realized, by the length of the barrel of the gun in her hands, that it would probably hold five rounds at a time. "
,......Yes. Kyrie and Rudolf were both very familiar with this gun. 
,"Rudolf, whose interest in guns from old westerns came from his Father, owned a shotgun of the same model. "
,"Even Kyrie had earned the qualifications to use that gun, becoming familiar enough with it that they could go shooting together for fun... "
,"Including the witch, there had been eight people there. Six people besides the two of them. "
,Each gun held five rounds. ...That was one short. They didn't have enough to kill everyone. 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...To be honest, it really surprised me when they got into a fight and one of the guns went off."" "
,That coincidental accident...had provided the missing bullet. 
,"It wasn't the second shot. The very first shot, which had accidentally killed Natsuhi, had guaranteed that this massacre would happen... "
,"In this smoke and corpse-filled room of gold, the two of them wore easygoing smiles, hardly any different from those they usually wore... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...What do we do now?"" "
,"Rudolf picked up Rosa's gun. Then, he fired a test shot at the wall and ejected the old shell with a smooth motion like Kyrie's. "
,"Kyrie went to the box of bullets on the table, casually picked up a few, and loaded them one after another into her gun. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Set the bomb switch to ""on"". Then, we just need to wait 24 hours."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Everyone's gonna run wild when morning comes and they can't find us."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Then we just need to make sure they don't."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Guess so. ...What about Battler?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""He's your son. Not mine."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Don't say that. Look how attached he is to you. He really respects you."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Then think of a clever way to trick him. I'll worry about Ange. You worry about Battler-kun. Fair enough?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Nng, ...sure."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I'm kind to my own children, ...but it's a real pain to be nice to Asumu-san's kid. You understand, I hope?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""............"" "
,Kyrie's voice had grown cold. 
,She had acted warmly towards Battler because that had been the adult thing to do. 
,"He was Rudolf's son, so she tried to avoid being hostile, nothing more. "
,"But underneath, he was the son of Asumu, a woman Kyrie still hated even though she was dead. "
,"Now that she had given birth to Ange and finally built up a new family, ......was Battler's return really such a happy thing for her...? "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Get yourself ready. Now that we've come this far, ...we can only go for the billion yen or die trying. If you can't convince Battler-kun, I'm sorry, but I won't be taking any chances."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...No need to threaten me. I'll take care of it. I'll find a good story to tell him."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Make sure you do. ...I know Ange will be very sad if she's forced to hear about Battler-kun dying in an accident."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sure... ......... ...How do we start?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""We have nothing to gain by waiting for morning. Now is the best time."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Oh, wonderful. Not even time for a break."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...A test? What's this supposed to be? At this time of night? Starting now?"" "
,Battler yelled wildly into the receiver. 
,"When he said ""at this time of night"", George and Jessica turned to look. "
,"According to the clock, it was past midnight. "
,"It might be a normal time to be told to brush their teeth and go to bed, but he couldn't understand what this test thing was all about. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Okay, I'll hand it over. ...Here, George-aniki. It's my dad."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Hello, this is George speaking."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Ah, hey, George-kun. Sorry to call so late. You weren't sleeping already, were you? You're all still up chatting away?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Pretty much. Maria-chan is sleeping...oh, wait, it looks like she just woke up. So, what did you want to talk about? Battler-kun said something about a test..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Ah, yeah. Dad can be such a pain sometimes. He suddenly came down from his room. A bunch of stuff happened, and by the end, he was talking about which grandchild would make the best Successor."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...But isn't Uncle Krauss the Successor?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""He says the four of us aren't up to the job, ...so he's gonna skip us adults and choose one of you grandkids instead. It's all so sudden, we're really freaking out here. Aniki and the others are all arguing about it across the room. I'll bet you can hear Aneki shrieking in the background, huh?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...I-Is that so? If that's what Grandfather says, then there's no way around it, I guess... In that case, what should we do?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""He says he wants to call you out one by one, starting with Jessica-chan. ...Oh, wait a sec. ............... ...Okay, you still there? It looks like you and Jessica-chan will be the first up to bat. He wants Jessica-chan to go to the parlor in the mansion. You're supposed to go out in front of the chapel."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It's so sudden, I hardly feel ready... What sort of test is it?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It looks like Dad made some kind of crazy quiz. ...Some weird questions about what it means to be the Head."" "
,"Of course, a few things about this seemed off to George. "
,"However, Kinzo was famous for doing radical things on a whim. ...Even this strange test seemed plausible once he heard that it was a sudden idea of Kinzo's. "
,"...But even so, if he wanted to test them one by one, why wouldn't he call them out one by one? "
,They could have just had everyone wait in some reception room to be called in one at a time. 
,"Why would two people be called to different places at the same time? The plan didn't seem to make sense, and George felt he was missing something. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Still, I wonder why he wanted to meet you in front of the chapel, of all places. ...He expects a lot from you. I think he wants to talk to you alone, not sure what about."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...Grandfather...wants to talk to me?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I wonder what he's got to say. I mean, you're the most talented of all his grandkids. He's probably got something to tell you in particular, right? ...Anyway, that's what he says. Get over there right away. I'm supposed to go to the chapel too, so let's get this over with, or we're both gonna catch colds."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......I see. Okay. Then I'll head towards the front of the chapel, and Jessica-chan will go to the parlor. ...Sure. I'll see you in a bit, then."" "
,What sort of test or private conversation...could Kinzo possibly want to have at this time of night? 
,"Then again, it's a well-known fact that Kinzo doesn't have long to live. "
,It wouldn't be so strange if he wanted to give some sort of will to each of his descendants individually... 
,"Inside George's mind, the faint feeling that something was wrong...was replaced by a desire to meet Kinzo directly and hear about this in more detail. "
,George set down the receiver and quickly explained to the others. 
Ushiromiya George,"""It's as you heard. ......Grandfather says he wants to give us all some kind of test."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-? A test...?"" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""After hiding in his study all these years, he suddenly decides to give us a test this late at night? ...Damn that old geezer. What's he thinking?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""It seems our parents feel the same way. It sounds as though they're very worked up about it."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Well, I doubt getting worked up about it will change Grandfather's mind."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Exactly. ...We might as well accept it. It's Grandfather's order, after all. Let's obey it. ...To start, Jessica-chan and I are being called out. I'm going to the chapel. Jessica-chan is supposed to go to the parlor in the mansion."" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What about Maria and me?"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""I think they'll contact you later. Wait here."" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-! A midnight test! What could it be?! What kind of test is it?! A quiz? A puzzle? I'm really good at wolves and sheep puzzles! Uu-!"" "
,"Maria, who was now fully awake, seemed to be very excited about this unexpected midnight test. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then we'll just hang out here."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Yes. Okay, I'm going. It sounds like they're already waiting for us."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...So, he's making one of his grandkids the Successor. Sounds great to me. Now I can let one of you guys deal with it!"" "
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I'm gonna become the Successor! I wanna do it! Uu-uu-uu-!"" "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ahaha. Having Maria as the Successor wouldn't be so bad."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Bye. See you later."" "
,Rudolf put down the receiver and stood up. 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Okay. ...Guess I'm going to the spot in front of the chapel. It's damn cold out there. ...Gohda-san, have some coffee waiting for me when I get back, will you?"" "
,"Next to Rudolf, ...Gohda was lying face-up. "
,His face was covered by a crossword puzzle book. 
,"However, its pages were stained with blood, and you didn't need to move the book to imagine how he had met his pitiful end... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""How was it? A nice script, don't you think?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Yep. We should be thanking Dad. If we just say it was him being fickle, no one's gonna doubt us."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle* Then let's split up. ...I'll take care of Jessica-chan. You take care of George-kun."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You got it. ...Let's get this over with quickly, so we can relax and have some coffee."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""There won't be any problems, yes? ...No sudden pangs of conscience?"" "
,Kyrie smiled coldly... 
,It probably would have been safer to call them out one by one and finish them off together. 
,"...However, Kyrie had chosen to have her husband work separately. "
,She wanted to measure Rudolf's resolve. 
,"If she was the only one who got her hands dirty, and Rudolf just watched, his heart wouldn't be as dedicated to this venture. "
,"By having him dirty his own hands, she could make him truly determined to see this thing through. "
,...Kyrie understood this sort of mind game better than anyone else. 
,"Rudolf reflexively averted his gaze from the cold glint in her eyes, but then he just shrugged and answered her question. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Of course. ......We have a billion yen riding on this. And I'm a man. I'm not gonna miss a chance that'll never come again in my lifetime."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I expected no less of you, Rudolf-san. ...I love people who seize chances when they come. That's why I fell in love with you."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Th-Thanks... I'm glad."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Rudolf-san."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""What...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Stay like that...always, okay?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Huh? What did you say?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Always remain the same Rudolf-san I love, ...okay?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Of course. When have I ever let you down? ...You should be worrying more about what kind of champagne we'll use to toast our victory."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I'll do that. ......Take care, now. If you really treasure Battler-kun, don't kill George-kun in front of the chapel, okay? It'll be a pain if he finds the body."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Yeah, I know. ...I'll lure him away somehow. We'll be outside, and it's raining. Should be some way to do it."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""And you aren't a villain in some old western, got it? Don't grant any last requests or take down any final messages, okay?"" "
,Kyrie lifted up her gun again and ran the lever... ...To eject the casing from the round she had killed Gohda with. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Dear... ...Deeeeeeeeear... Waaaaaaahhhhh..."" "
,Eva was holding Hideyoshi's body and crying. 
,She hadn't been shot at all. The bullet had grazed her head...and missed. 
,She hadn't been playing dead. She really thought that she'd been shot. 
,"When Kyrie's gun spat fire, Eva felt something fierce skim past her head... before feeling light-headed and fainting. "
,"Then, she had awoken in the now silent room of the gold. "
,"The remains of her beloved husband lay beside her. As well as Krauss, Natsuhi, and Rosa's corpses. "
,It was a room of death and piled up bodies... 
,"When she had cried all she could over Hideyoshi's body, ...she realized that she still had something she needed to do. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...George is in danger... ...George, ...George...!"" "
,"They're trying to use the bomb to blow up everything, to bury this whole island with an ""explosion accident"". "
,...Of course. 
,"As Eva had expected, the switch on the clock was set to the right, which meant that it was active. "
,Eva moved to flip it to the left...and stopped. 
,"That's right. As long as this switch points to the right, ...everything that happens will disappear in this night of illusions. "
,"Yes, this is an illusion. "
,"No matter what happens tonight, everything will become muddled and hidden away. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""They're probably going to kill everyone else. That has to be it... I'm sure of it...!"" "
,"When she looked at the table with the box of bullets, she saw signs that they had roughly grabbed a bunch of bullets before leaving. "
,It clearly showed...that they planned to use that many bullets. 
,...I have to fight. 
,...If only to protect just the life of my precious son... 
,The gun that I dropped when I was shot is stuck with the lever open. 
,"No matter how hard I pull, it won't open any further, and it won't close again. "
,"...Apparently, a bullet has gotten jammed, breaking it. "
,...It's just as Kyrie said. Loading a bullet is tough if you aren't used to it. 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Please, dear... Lend me your strength... ...Lend me your strength, so that I can protect George..."" "
,"In Hideyoshi's hand was Krauss's gun, which he had been trying to pick up. "
,"Eva took it, ...prayed to her husband one more time, and tugged on the lever handle. "
,"...With a light metallic sound, ...the golden casing spun through the air... and bounced off the ground. "
,"When she timidly tried to push the lever back, ...this time it returned to its original place without any resistance. "
,...There was another metallic clang. 
,It was the sound of a new bullet being loaded... 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Hmph. I figured it'd be something like this. ...Someone's scheming to show me the game that'd disgust me most, just to mock me..."" "
,"In the games so far, various people have been suspected of being the culprit or an accomplice. "
,The only difference now was that Rudolf and Kyrie were those suspects... 
,"However, to Ange, that was the most infuriating plot twist possible. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""............"" "
,Even Lion was full of painful thoughts. 
,"Solving the epitaph was supposed to be the only miracle that could lead to a game without a single victim, ...but ironically, the tragedy hadn't been averted even so. "
,"Does this mean we aren't allowed to have a future where we all happily return from this island alive, ...even if the epitaph is miraculously solved before the crime occurs...? "
,A miracle certainly will not occur. 
,"...Those words, which I had heard in one of the Fragments {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown me, raced through my mind... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""{f:5:Bernkastel}-san... You showed me how wonderful my world was... ...I don't want to believe that you created this tale just to hurt Ange..."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...By now, even I realize that you're the Game Master here. ...Please, tell me. ...Why are you showing us this game...?"" "
,"Of course, no one answered Lion's muttered question. "
,"The game created to mock Ange continued emotionlessly, ...with more terrible twists that didn't betray anyone's expectations anymore... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Ha! Show whatever terrible game you like! You're trying to say that this is one of the endless possibilities inside the cat box, right?! Just do whatever you want...! I won't let something like this get to me!! Someday, I'll find out the truth of what happened on October 5th, 1986!!"" "
,"After meeting Kyrie in the parlor, Jessica was told that the test would be held in the dining hall, and she followed Kyrie there... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Aunt Kyrie, there's no one here."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""He'll be here soon. Sit over there."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""............"" "
,"Jessica sat in the chair she had been offered, looking nervous and agitated. "
,Kyrie was by far the calmer of the two. 
,"Kyrie closed the door behind her, revealing the gun that rested behind it. Jessica was facing the other way, so she saw nothing... "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""...Did you hear anything about this, Aunt Kyrie? Like what kind of test this is?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Yes. It'll be over soon."" "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I sure hope so."" "
,"As she complained, Jessica turned her head around, and the tip of her nose bumped into cold metal. "
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......Huh-"" "
Ushiromiya George,"""U-Uncle Rudolf...?! What...are you doing...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Heheh. I guess shooting people in the back just isn't for me after all."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...H-Hey, ...that was dangerous. What on earth are you doing...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Come on, why else would someone point a gun and pull the trigger?"" "
,Rudolf reloaded rapidly and pulled the trigger again without any sign of hesitation. 
,"As the sound of gunfire thundered through the rain, George grabbed at his side and fell to his knees... "
Ushiromiya George,"""Unnggg...ggnhh...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""That's weird. I guess it really does shoot low. ...This gun's really got it bad."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""S-Somebody...!! Help me, ...Uncle Rudolf is...!!"" "
,"George started stumbling away, still clutching at his side. His voice as he called for help was weak and thin. "
,"In comparison, Rudolf, who stood behind him, looked perfectly calm as he fiddled with his gun and checked his sights. "
Ushiromiya George,"""...It hurts... ...It hurts... ...Gah, ...nngg...!"" "
,It felt to George as though something had been gouged into his side. It was so painful that he could barely stand and walk... 
,He leaned against the trunk of a tree. 
,"After he crouched down, trying to cover his wound, ...he was no longer able to stand back up. "
,"George didn't have a clue what was going on. However, he had felt as though something was wrong this whole time. "
,"Of course it was strange that he'd be called out alone to a place like this, at a time like this. "
,"...And yet, ...how could he have known that something was wrong...? "
,"After all, ...his own uncle... had told him that his grandfather was asking him to join the family conference. ...How could he have suspected...? "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Sorry 'bout this, George-kun. It hurts, doesn't it? If I knew it'd come to this, it would've been kinder to blow out your brains from behind. I thought it'd be too cruel to finish you off before you knew what hit you, but it looks like I got it backwards."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""......Wh- Why, Uncle Rudolf...? Why would... ...my kind uncle... do... this......?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Forget about this. By tomorrow night, all of it won't have happened."" "
,"With a quick use of the lever handle, he loaded another bullet. "
,The casing of the bullet that had pierced George's side fell heartlessly in front of him... 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Everyone's gonna die in a sudden, unfortunate accident. Until that moment, we'll all be a big, happy family. ...That's how it's gonna be. So don't worry about this. Forget it all."" "
,"Of course, George didn't have a clue what Rudolf was talking about. "
,"All he knew was that Rudolf wanted to kill him, and that he showed no trace of hesitation... "
,"...His image of Rudolf as the ideal cool, joke-loving adult... didn't match up with the man standing in front of him, holding a gun. "
,"No, maybe this feels wrong because it fits him too well. "
,"He has that same smile, as though he's about to tell some hilarious joke, ...but he's pointing a gun at me. "
,"...Why would that kind, ...funny Uncle Rudolf... ...do this...? "
,"It made him feel unimaginably sad, ...and tears flowed from his eyes. "
Ushiromiya George,"""Uu, ...uuuuuu...Uncle Rudolf... ......I......admired you so much......"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Haven't I always told you, George-kun? ...Make sure you don't end up as an adult like me. Now you see why. In the next world, make learning how to spot villains your first priority. ...I know you can do it. After all, it's just another kind of studying."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""Uu...*hic*...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!"" "
,"He bit down the pain in his side. ...With the last of his strength, George threw his whole body into a roundhouse kick. "
,"At the same time, fire spat from Rudolf's gun. "
,...The bullet pierced George's chest. George spun around as he fell amidst an outpouring of blood. 
,"He moaned wordlessly, clenching bloodstained teeth. A frigid gun was pressed harshly against his temple. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""So long. ...Go become a great man in the next world. Don't get blinded by money like me."" "
Ushiromiya George,"""...I can't believe... ...that my uncle... ...would kill for money... Aaaaaaaahhhhh......"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You're so innocent. ...People can kill... over money."" "
,The ruthless trigger forestalled any further questions. 
,"George's hands, which had been covering his wound, dropped lifelessly... "
,"When Rudolf saw the last glimmer of life leave him, he sighed deeply and looked tired. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Heh, ...hahahahahahahahahaha. ......That was easier than I'd thought."" "
,"Rudolf looked up into the dark, rainy sky, the rain drops hitting him full in the face, ...and laughed with an indescribable expression, his tongue hanging out. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I thought my conscience would bug me more. ...Now that it's over, it was pretty easy."" "
,"*giggle*giggle*, gahahahahahaha. Rudolf laughed. This was probably just the thing Kyrie had hoped for. "
,It had taken considerable effort to kill George. 
,"...He may have been merciless, but the last traces of a conscience in Rudolf's heart had probably slowed him down. "
,"However, now that he had killed someone with his own hands, a turning point that few people ever reach, ...Rudolf had finally awakened. "
,"...No, he finally understood. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...It's just like squeezing dough out of a bunch of morons. ...The same old game of musical chairs. If there's a pile of money in front of you, the first one to reach it wins. The slow ones just get kicked down to hell."" "
,Haven't I driven dozens of poor fools into debt with my earlier swindles? 
,"Several of those probably ended up bankrupt, and some of those might've hanged themselves. And I always laughed like it was none of my business. "
,And that's all there is to it. 
,"The only difference now is that, for the first time, ...I've dealt the final blow with my own hands. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Thanks, Kyrie. ...You're always the best at cutting away my naivety. ...Heheheh, ...hehhahahahahahah! Hyahhhahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!!!"" "
,Rudolf's evil laugh rang out. 
,"The laugh was so purely evil, it was almost soothing. Hypocritical evil that still contains some pangs of conscience is far more repulsive to behold. "
,"If a man's committed to doing great evil anyway, how much more pleasant and gallant it is when he's wholly devoted to his goal. "
,"In that sense, Rudolf's evil smile and laugh... were pleasant and gallant indeed... "
,Which means... 
,"The brutal, bloody stage of the dining hall...must have been soothing as well. "
,"A clang. A thud. A crack, a squish. ...A strange mixture of these sounds kept repeating over and over at the same tempo. "
,"...Each time, a red splash landed on the tablecloth dangling nearby. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Jessica-chan, ......can you hear me...?"" "
,"Kyrie asked this with the sort of smile any aunt might make to her niece. However, Jessica didn't answer. "
,There was nothing particularly surprising about this. 
,"...After all, by now, ...her nose had been broken, her eyes had been smashed, ...her teeth had been knocked out, and not only her nose, but her entire face was now hardly recognizable as a face, ...just a lump of bloody flesh... "
,Kyrie finally stopped her task of repeatedly smashing Jessica's face with the stock of her gun. 
,"Still sitting on top of Jessica, she tossed her gun to the side, ...pulled a compact out of her pocket, and looked at her own face in the mirror. "
,"Then, finally, ...she realized that her face was covered by speckles of fresh blood. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""How terrible. These clothes will have to go too. ...*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"" "
,"With a muffled laugh, Kyrie shakily rose to her feet. "
,"Jessica wasn't moving anymore. ...She had been convulsing a bit until a second ago, but now, she was as still as stone. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Smashing a woman's face is nothing new to your aunt, okay? Sorry about that. ...If you hadn't resisted, I could've given you a much cleaner death."" "
,Kyrie pulled the tablecloth off and used it like a towel to wipe the blood from all over her body. 
,"However, instead of taking the blood off, it just smeared it around... and did nothing to remove the stench of blood and death that covered her. "
,"When she got tired of rubbing the tablecloth against the blood, Kyrie walked over to the extension line telephone in the corner of the room. "
,"Then, she dialed the number for the cousin room in the guesthouse... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Hello. It's me. ...It's your turn now, Battler-kun. Go to the spot in front of the chapel, please. ......Yes, that's right. I haven't been given any instructions for Maria-chan. Have her wait there. ......*giggle* Yes, keep your wits about you. ...I'm rooting for you to be chosen as the Successor, Battler-kun."" "
,"With the same smile as usual and the partly-wiped splashes of blood still covering her face, ...Kyrie finished her call to Battler. "
,"When she set down the receiver, there was a small knock, and Rudolf came back into the room. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Hey, you look like shit."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Jessica-chan has better reflexes than I gave her credit for. I didn't think she'd be able to fight back from a situation like that."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It's a bit of a shame she had to end up looking like this. ...What a waste of a good, Natsuhi-esque woman."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""And how about your end? Did he give you much trouble?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""No problems there. Plain and simple."" "
,"When Kyrie heard Rudolf's instant response, she favored him with an evil smile. "
,"Yes, the man she loved was the sort who could do it if he tried, without letting cheap emotions get in the way... "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I love you, Rudolf-san. I wouldn't have it any other way."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It's hard to imagine an easier job to net you a billion yen. ...It's like Dad always said. In the life of every man, there comes one day when he has to be willing to kill."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""In other words, always be determined to survive, even if you have to kill to do it. ...That's my favorite line of his."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""What's next? My rifle is hungry for blood."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You've got a big job coming up. Convincing Battler-kun."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Ah, that's right. That'll be a pain. Hope I don't have to end it by pulling the trigger."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I've really enjoyed life as a three-person family with Ange. ...But, if you really want Battler-kun to join in on that, ...give it your best."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sure. ...I'll make sure we don't have any complaints from him. Don't worry, I've worked out a scenario to trick him good."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Good luck. Even I hope that Ange's beloved big brother doesn't get caught up in the explosion accident."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I know. Then, I'll head back to the chapel."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Rudolf-san."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""What...?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......If you can't convince Battler-kun..."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...... ...I know, I know. If that happens, bang."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Battler-kun is independent enough that he left the family out of protest when I married you, remember? ...If you can only convince him halfway, and if things get nasty later on, ...he'll prove fatal to us."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I know. Believe in me."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...And if... If I decide that Battler-kun is growing suspicious, ...I'll kill him myself. He's not my kid, after all."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Yeah, I know. ...So, promise me one thing, Kyrie."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""What's that...?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""If...I can trick Battler, and the three of us make it off this island..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...If that happens, what?"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...... ...Never say that Battler isn't your kid again. ...After all, ...you're his mother. ...Please."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...... ...Sure, I promise."" "
,Kyrie shrugged and answered as she loaded bullets. 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You go to the chapel. I'll wait until Battler-kun has left, and then clean up everything inside the guesthouse."" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Are you sure you'll be okay doing that alone?"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's my line."" "
,Battler left the guesthouse under an umbrella. 
,"He had been called to the area in front of the chapel, just like George had been. "
,"Not even 30 minutes had passed since the time George and Jessica had been called out. ...Apparently, this test didn't last too long. "
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Damn geezer. First you never come out, not even for lunch, and then you show up in the middle of the night with a test. ...I'll bet living as a shut-in's got his sense of day and night all backwards."" "
,"Complaining all the way, Battler strolled off into the rain. "
,"Almost immediately, he was swallowed up by the darkness of the rose garden and passed out of sight... "
,......And then... 
,Kyrie could be seen coming out from the darkness of the rose garden. 
,Her right hand held a gun. Her left an umbrella. 
,Her inner pocket contained the master key ring she had stolen from Gohda. 
,Her right pocket had a handful of bullets. Her left held a knife she had taken from the kitchen. 
,She was a carefully and perfectly outfitted murderer. 
,Another bolt of lightning struck down from the swirling skies. It lit up only half of Kyrie's face. 
,Her cheek...was still covered with Jessica's blood... 
,"Under the eaves, Kyrie folded up her umbrella, smiled, and spoke to no one. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Hey everyone, I'm home."" "
,Rudolf could be seen under the eaves of the chapel. He had hidden his gun in the nearby shadows and was now smoking a cigarette... 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Should be easy to trick that dimwit. ...And if it doesn't work, that's just too bad."" "
,He glanced over at the place he had stowed his gun. The cigarette smoke began to pleasantly cloud his mind. 
,"...Battler isn't a kid anymore. He's an adult, who can choose his path through life as he pleases. "
,"When animals grow up, it's normal for them to form a group and go on a journey. Humans are the only ones that keep treating their young like kids even after they get big... "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...If I'd known it'd come to this, I never would've begged for you to come back. ...I regret...dragging you back into the family..."" "
,He puffed out those words... ...along with the smoke. 
,"When Battler came, he didn't intend to voice those regrets of his. "
,Rudolf was already determined to play the part of the evil murderer who kills for money... 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...He's still not here. ...What's taking him so long?"" "
,"At that moment, he heard the sound of someone stepping on gravel. "
,"He looked up, thinking that Battler had finally arrived, ...but the sound had come from the direction opposite of the mansion. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""............!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Rudolf... ...How could you... do that...to my husband...?!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Aneki... So, you're alive..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Sorry that I'm alive! Too bad! But my husband wasn't so lucky... How could you... How could you...?!!"""
,"With a face obscured by anger and tears, Eva slowly walked closer, her gun raised. "
,Her husband had been killed right in front of her. She probably wouldn't even hesitate. 
,"Realizing that a gun, quivering with anger, was pointed right at his chest, Rudolf backed away. "
,"As he pretended to retreat, ...he approached the gun he had hidden in the shadows. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""C-Calm down, Aneki... Put the gun down... ...I never wanted that to happen. Everything happened so fast. There was nothing I could do...!"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""How can you tell such half-baked lies?!!"" "
,"As Eva had said, it really had been a half-baked, pointless thing to say. "
,"Rudolf would have said anything if he thought it would calm Eva's emotions before she pulled the trigger, which she looked capable of doing at any moment now... "
,"...Then, Rudolf's foot came in contact with his gun. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""L-Let's just talk this over. ...George-kun should be here soon. ...Oh. ...Hey, George-kun, we're over here."" "
,"Rudolf waved, as though George was coming from behind Eva. "
,Let Eva's attention turn in that direction... 
,"...That idiot. My simple, big sister has always been a sucker. "
,Die!!! 
,Gunfire. 
,"...Then, a bit later, the sound of something heavier than rain drip-dropping onto the cobblestone. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Agh, ......nggg..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Rudolf... I've always been able to see through your tricks...!!"" "
,"The bullet Eva fired went straight into Rudolf's chest. The bullet Rudolf fired at Eva missed, landing near her feet. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Guess I was...right... This gun... does shoot low..."" "
,"He dropped the gun into a puddle with a splash, staggered backwards, and leaned against the wall of the chapel. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Nah, that's not it... ...All good westerns end...with the bad guy's bullet missing..."" "
,"Eva dashed up to him, kicked away the gun that had fallen into a puddle, and grabbed Rudolf by the collar. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What about George?! Where is he?! I won't let you kill him...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Sorry, Aneki. ...Already...got him."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Liar!!"" "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Did it in the bushes over there. ...Go take a look. You'll see soon..."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......R- Rudolf, ...you......"" "
,"Eva, who claimed to know all of her little brother's tricks, ...also knew that Rudolf's final words, as his consciousness began to fade thanks to the bullet wound, were not a lie. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""How could you... George, ...Geoooooooooooooooooorrge!!!"" "
,An empty shell casing bounced off the cobblestone. The furious gun barrel was pressed against Rudolf's forehead. 
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Go ahead and shoot. ...I doubt that'll bring you much peace though."" "
,"A bolt of lightning turned everything white. However, the wall of the chapel was stained blood red. "
,"A red splash, like a crushed tomato, came out from the back of Rudolf's head and covered the wall... "
,"Then, leaving a red trail behind him, ...Rudolf sagged downwards, sat on the ground, and fell over. "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""George, Geooooooooorge!! Geooooooooorge, uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"" "
,"Eva dashed off towards the bushes. ...She found George's corpse almost immediately, screamed, and broke down sobbing. "
,...Rudolf's bloody corpse was exposed to the rain that ran down off the eaves. 
,"His eyes were still wide open. A fist-sized, flesh-covered hole was open in the back of his head, ...and his insides were exposed to the open air. "
,"Inside was a mixed jelly of flesh, brains, and spinal fluid. "
,"That goop, which looked like someone had mixed it up with a spoon, dripped from his eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and the hole in his head... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...Dad, ...Dad... ...Aaaaaaaaahhh...!!!"" "
,"Ange clutched at her head, sobbing and moaning. "
,"Her father had dirtied his hands with murder over money, and on top of that, he had faced such a cruel end, and Ange had been forced to see his corpse. It was hard to imagine a more painful experience for a daughter to go through. "
,...I'm totally fed up with this. It's completely meaningless. 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""{f:5:Bernkastel}-san...! I know you're here somewhere! Please, make this game stop...!! There's no point to it!"" "
,"As if in answer to that yell, ...a black shadow appeared a few seats in front of them. "
,Or perhaps she was sitting there the whole time. 
,Maybe we just couldn't see her until we were aware of her. 
,"It was, without a doubt, the back of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s head. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""{f:5:Bernkastel}-san...!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Pipe down back there. Can't you watch the show quietly?"" "
,The witch turned around with bored eyes. ...As though the two people yelling were the strange ones. 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Please stop this...! We realize that this is the sealed cat box world of October 4th and 5th...!"" "
,The games are like messages. 
,Or maybe more like a roundabout love letter. A single message can be conveyed over several games. 
,"But now, we understand. We know that endless tales can seep out of the sealed, two-day cat box. "
,"And beyond that, I even know the culprit and the motive. That has already been revealed, and it doesn't even have anything to do with this game. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""We both know the answer, that this is a cat box tale...! So, there shouldn't be any need for any further games...!! If this is supposed to be a game between you and us, then we already know the answer...!! The game should be over!!"" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Just shut up already. Didn't you hear Bern tell you to be quiet?"" "
,"Another shadow appeared in the next seat over, turned around, and scolded the pair. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......There is a point. If you just watch, you'll see it. ...*giggle*giggle*."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Are you the Game Master...?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Not at all."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Then who is it?! Could it be...Clair...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""If you watch, you'll see. Not much longer now. ...*giggle*giggle*."" "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""The tragedy has already reached its climax. Who'll survive, I wonder? Heheheheheheheheh..."" "
,{f:5:Bernkastel} isn't the Game Master...? 
,Then who is? Could Clair have created this cruel tale...? 
,Or are there even more witches playing around with this cat box...? 
,The guesthouse...was wrapped in silence. 
,There were no sounds. 
,No trace of anyone's presence. No breathing from anyone alive. 
,There wasn't anything to be heard anymore... 
,If anything could be heard... ...It was the sound of the murderer's feet stepping across the floor... 
,Kyrie slowly passed through the lounge. 
,In her right hand...was a gun. In her left hand...was a knife. 
,"The knife was stained with blood, and some was still dripping from the tip, ...leaving behind red tracks like a demon's footprints... "
,"Her hands were filled with tools of murder. So, she wasn't capable of doing anything but murder. "
,"In that sense, at that moment, she was clearly and purely a murderer. "
,"...The murderer went to the entrance hall, and then, only after reaching the front door, looked down to see the two bloodstained hands of a killer. "
,Those hands gripped the tools of death that had performed a cruel massacre. 
,"Then, at last, the murderer realized that it wouldn't even be possible to open the door like this...and tossed aside the knife... "
,"Then, the murderer reached out to the door, turned around calmly, ...and spoke. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Sorry, everyone. ...But don't worry. A few days later, the newspapers will be talking about an unfortunate accident. ...And I'm sure the news shows, the papers, and rumormongers everywhere will be sure that you spent your time in happy ignorance until the instant of the accident. ...In other words, you'll all have had a good time until midnight on October 5th."" "
,So said the one who had stained that bloody guesthouse red. 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""At this hour, the cousins are all staying up late and playing around. ...And the servants who have to get up early are all snoring. The ones on the late shift are probably filling in the log or taking a break about now."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...That's how it is. From where I am now, I can hear laughter coming from the cousin room. ......*giggle*."" "
,Humans outside the cat box would probably never understand what Kyrie was saying. 
,"Only she, shut inside the cat box of the explosion accident, could know what it really meant... "
,"Outside, the rain poured down heavily. "
,"Kyrie almost picked up an umbrella, but then stopped suddenly, as if she'd just thought of something. "
,"Then, she started walking out into the rain, not caring at all whether she got wet or not... "
,Did the murderer not want an umbrella to get in the way of her gun? ...Or was she hoping that the rain could act as a shower to get the blood off her? 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............"" "
,"Kyrie stopped walking. As though something unexpected had caught her attention. However, this time, it was no whim of hers... "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......How could you... ...kill my husband...?!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Oh, ...Eva nee-san. ...That's surprising. How could I have missed you from that distance?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I'm just as surprised. I didn't think I'd survive."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...You came here from the underground stairway behind the chapel, right? ...In that case-"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. I bumped into Rudolf in front of the chapel!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""And how was he doing?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Oh, just wonderful. We managed to have a friendly sibling chat for the first time in a while."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...... ...I see. ...He's such a show-off, but so unreliable in a tight spot. ...Looks like he can't do anything without me after all."" "
,"After that short exchange of words, Kyrie already knew that Rudolf had been killed. "
,"However, no trace of urgency or panic rose to her face. "
,"She just closed her eyes with her usual unconcerned expression, ...and when she opened them again, she had regained her composed smile. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...Thank you. I'm grateful. This way, I really can have everything to myself."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What's that blood on your clothes...? You just came out of the guesthouse, didn't you...? ...Don't tell me..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Yes, that's right. ...I'm right in the middle of a murder case at the moment."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You killed them?! All of them?!! Even Maria-chan...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""There was no need to let them live until morning. When morning came, there would be an uproar, and that could be a pain. They might've used a radio to contact someone off the island and gotten help. ...So, this was clearly the optimal move to take. If you spin the chessboard around and look at it that way, right...?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Monster!! I can't believe you could be so blinded by greed that you'd commit murder...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You weren't doing so bad yourself."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That was an accident!! I didn't mean to kill them! Unlike you!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""No, just like me. ...If that gun hadn't gone off, you would've kept on arguing and jumping at each other. Then, the rest of you would've eventually reached the same answer as me, just a few steps slower."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I'm not a murderer!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Not true. You're just a murderer who didn't get a chance. You've just been saved by that accidental discharge. ......If it weren't for that bit of good luck, and if I hadn't moved before you did, ...then you would've played the same role I'm playing now. That fact won't go away, no matter how much you try to deny it. It's the truth of a different future."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""D-Don't try and confuse me!"" "
,"However, ...on the inside, Eva understood. "
,"Back then, she had probably been saved by that accidental discharge, by a coincidence. "
,"If the argument had continued much longer, she would surely have grown a desire to kill Krauss and the others, and might even have carried it out. "
,...She simply could not deny the existence of that demon deep within her heart. 
,Only the theatergoers knew. They knew that she could become a killer in another world. 
,"Kyrie, who didn't have the theatergoing ability, knew this fact as well. ...Maybe there really was something extraordinary about her after all. "
,"So, for some time, Eva could only grind her teeth in silence, still pointing her gun... "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I don't understand. You're also a mother. You've felt the pain of giving birth to your own child. How can you not know how precious a life is...?! How are you capable of doing all this...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's the thing about kids. If you just sleep around, they get made all by themselves."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's not what I'm talking about...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""They say that children are bonds, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Children are bonds used to tie you to your husband. ...She was a bond to make Rudolf-san acknowledge me, so I could take him back from that woman."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""But you've killed Rudolf-san now. ...You understand what that means, right?"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What do you mean, ...I understand?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Just that right now, I'm the wife of no man, and I have no intention of being a mother. ...I am me. Kyrie. Now that Rudolf-san's dead, I'm not even an Ushiromiya anymore. I live to benefit me."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Right, Rudolf is dead, so maybe you aren't a wife anymore. But you still have Ange-chan, don't you...?! You're still a mother, aren't you...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Didn't you hear what I just said about bonds? Now that Rudolf-san is gone, Ange is of no use to me."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Y- You, ...how can any mother say that about her own daughter?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Eva nee-san, let's put a stop to this. We can be honest here."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Honest...?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Did either of us marry because we wanted children? We didn't, right? We married because we wanted to live with the man we loved. And, once you've married, you never want to let that man go, for the rest of your life, correct? Children are just weapons to be used for that goal."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I'd never have children for a reason like that...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""But people can have children for just that reason."" "
,"Kyrie kept on speaking emotionlessly, ignoring the falling rain... Her relaxed smile didn't falter for an instant. "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Ange was just a chain I used to tie Rudolf-san to me. ...Or, you could call her a chess piece, someone to play the role of the kid in our family drama. ...To me, Ange was nothing more than a piece, necessary so that I could act the part of the good mother in front of Rudolf-san."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...You... ...Could you say that to Ange-chan's face?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That would be just a bit too sad, so I won't say it to her directly. I plan to write her a letter asking her to forgive her bad mother, then vanish from her life. You've seen what Rosa-san and Maria-chan are like, right? Now that Rudolf-san's gone, Ange's just a chain tying me down."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...I'll go back to being just Kyrie, and enjoy the rest of my life at my leisure. A new challenge, and a new life. And maybe even a new love. *giggle*......"" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...And you call yourself human... ...You call yourself Ange-chan's mother?!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle*giggle* Who gives a damn about Ange? I've never liked that little brat."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...H-How can you..."" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You've been released from your family drama too, haven't you? Let's sing the praises of a woman's freedom. You should thank me for having George-kun killed for you too."" "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Y-You...monsteeeeeeeeeer!!"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Ahhahhahahahahhaaahhhyahhahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"" "
,The two yells...and the sound of gunfire...thundered across the dark rose garden. 
,"...Slowly, Eva fell backwards. "
,"Then, she landed in a puddle, ...scattering countless drops of water. "
,"Across from her, Kyrie spun around as though dancing. "
,"Beautiful, black rose petals scattered around her. "
,"The petals...were a dark, dark red. "
,"...As they sprayed from her throat, she spun around in a circle, ...and slowly crumpled. "
,"Then, she fell to the ground, sending muddy water flying. "
,The two women had shot...and fallen...... 
,"However, when the thunder roared, only Eva sat back up... "
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......*pant*... ...*pant*... ...*pant*..."" "
,Eva hadn't been shot. 
,"Kyrie's intensity had made her fall backwards, ...but the bullet had once again slipped right past her... "
,Eva cursed her good luck. Why couldn't this luck have saved her husband or her son? 
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Die there, ...for Ange-chan's sake as well. ......You'll be killed in the explosion accident. Until the moment of your death, you worried about the daughter you left behind. ...Yes. I'll write that into the lid of the cat box......"" "
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""..............."" "
,"When Kyrie heard this, ...blood dripped from her grinning mouth, and she seemed to say something in response. "
,"However, her voice came out only as globs of blood from the hole in her throat, not words... "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""M... Mom... ...Mom, uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...! It's... a lie... ...It's all a lie...!! Aaaaaaagggghhhhhh...!!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Ange, ...please, calm down...! This is just a game...! That couldn't possibly be what your mother truly feels...! It's just something that the Game Master made Aunt Kyrie's piece say...!!"" "
,But saying that did nothing to calm Ange's sobs. 
,"I don't blame her. Even if she knows it's just a game, ...she's been forced to see, not only her mother's death, ...but also her mother announcing that she was the culprit of a mass murder, who didn't even love her own daughter. Anyone would sob after hearing that... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""{f:5:Bernkastel}-san!! Enough of this!! I don't care who the Game Master is!! Stop this pointless game right now!!"" "
,"When Lion yelled this, the theater suddenly went pitch-black, swallowed in darkness. "
,"However, that wasn't enough to shock Lion. "
,"Lion continued to yell {f:5:Bernkastel}'s name into the darkness, telling the witch to stop this game. "
,"Then, a single beam of light shone down upon the stage. "
,"There was Clair, the one who had appeared for just a second right before this cruel game began. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Clair...!! So, ...you were the Game Master after all?! ...I don't get it. Why?!"" "
,Clair didn't answer. 
,"...In fact, ...it looked as though she hadn't even heard. "
,"Her eyes were blank, and you couldn't tell what she was looking at. In fact, she was even forgetting to blink... "
,...She looked...just like a doll... 
,"Then, another beam of light lit up the side of the stage. "
,Beneath that light...stood {f:5:Bernkastel}. 
,"At the same moment, though there appeared to be no one in the audience, a thunderous applause rang out... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......*giggle*."" "
,{f:5:Bernkastel} raised her right hand in response to the applause. She kept doing so until it died down... 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""{f:5:Bernkastel}-san!! So, ...you were the Master of this game after all...!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Lion, how many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the Game Master?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Then are you saying it's Clair?! That's impossible...!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yep. Of course it's impossible. After all, Clair died. ...We were just conducting her funeral. Did you forget that...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Then just who is standing there...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""A corpse. She's not a mannequin. So, of course, she still has her insides. ...She's hiding it under a beautiful exterior, but she's actually packed full of guts."" "
,"When {f:5:Bernkastel} raised her right hand, ...a light fell on it, and a black, shining scythe appeared there. "
,"It was a cold, merciless, and cruel object, like something a classic grim reaper might hold. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Wh-What are you planning to do...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle. When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts. Tales are things you get to enjoy twice. ...That's what it means to be a witch of theatergoing."" "
,{f:5:Bernkastel} pressed the blade of her reaper's scythe against Clair's stomach... and slowly slid it across. 
,"Then, along the line she traced, Clair's dress was sliced open. "
,"It was now clear that the scythe she held was not a fake one for theatrical use. ...And, it was clear just what she planned to do next that made her cruel smile so fitting. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ange, can you hear me?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I hear you... You tear me to bits, make me read! What's next?! Are you showing me this worst possible tale to hurt me even more?! "
Ushiromiya Ange,"Is this fun for you?! Yeah, I'll bet it is. I had a blast too...! You think...that I'd give up after that?! You think...I'll sit around crying any longer because of that disgusting game of yours?!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Both you and Lion... seem to have the wrong idea. I'm not the Game Master. This tale is not one that I created."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Then that woman in the dress is the Game Master?!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""No, she isn't...! That can't be! Then who is the Game Master?! Who wove this disgusting tale?!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You still don't understand?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What don't we understand?!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ange, you gambled everything on a faint chance of a miracle, throwing yourself forward. ...I invited you to October 4th and 5th of 1986 out of respect for your courage."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...What was your goal? To take your family back. ...That would be a very difficult thing, and without the blessing of a miracle, a thoroughly impossible one. You were prepared for that, weren't you?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yes, I'm prepared...!! And I still haven't given up on Onii-chan, Mom, and Dad!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Whether you give up or not is your choice. That's your own game, after all. I won't support you, and I won't even watch. I've already enjoyed my fill of games that use the piece you are, so I have no need for you any longer."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Glad to hear it. Then why am I here? Aren't you the one who invited me?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yes, that's right. I invited you here. ...To thank you for entertaining me for a while, as my piece."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""To thank me?! Hah, so this is how witches show gratitude!! Sure, this has been loads of fun, you beast! How could you make this kind... this kind of game... and do that to Dad and Mom?!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ange, you made a wish, hoping to take your family back. However, you also made another wish. Remember?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No, I don't!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You wanted to know what happened on that day."" "
,"What happened on Rokkenjima on October 4th and 5th, 1986? "
,Didn't Ange leave on her journey with Amakusa because she longed to answer that question? 
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's right... So what's your point?!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...You don't...mean..."" "
,Lion realized what {f:5:Bernkastel} was getting at. 
,Realized...and was unable to say any more... 
,The Game Master is neither {f:5:Bernkastel} nor Clair. 
,Then who is it...? 
,That's the wrong question. There is...no Game Master. 
,That could mean only one thing... 
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ange, you still don't understand?"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""...What...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""This is the truth. The insides of the cat box of October 4th and 5th, 1986. Afterwards, Eva survived the explosion by escaping to Kuwadorian. ...And, since she never spoke of the inside of the cat box no matter how much you wanted to know, that truth was shut within the cat box for all eternity."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What...are you saying...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Only Eva returned alive. Even though the police claimed it was an accident, the public didn't believe it. Then, she took over her husband's company, and the harder she worked to make it more and more successful, the more enemies she made. A public image of her as a great queen of conspiracy grew stronger and stronger."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...I'm sure she wanted to tell people about the truth. That truth that no one would ever believe without proof. ...Bit by bit, Eva's heart began to snap. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"You rejected Eva, so she rejected you in turn. The relationship between the last two members of your family was strained to the limit. Each time she compared you with her beloved son, she grew more and more twisted and broken."" "
,"Then, a strange message bottle was picked up and became a topic of conversation. "
,"It contained a bizarre story, one that told of a mysterious serial murder connected to Rokkenjima's gold. "
,Everyone rejected the explosion accident theory and started to think up conspiracy theories. 
,"Some of those theories named Eva as the culprit, which tormented her even more. "
,"However, Eva used even that...to build up the cat box. "
,"And until the moment of her death, she protected it. She protected the lock that held the cat box shut. "
,"So, no Human would ever reach the truth inside the cat box. Not unless those witches who cross the sea of Fragments opened the lock... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""This is the truth."" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......You're lying... ...You're lying, ...lying...!! If this really is the truth, you should be able to say so in red!! There's no way you can, of course there isn't!! Nngyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Ange...!! Ange, calm down...!! Uu, ...ah...?!"" "
,Ange writhed with such strength that the chains on her arms and legs looked like they might snap. 
,"All over her body, ...a red, gooey liquid started to seep out. "
,It was as though cracks had opened up all over her and blood was leaking out of all of them. 
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""What's that? You want me to announce it clearly with the red truth? Then I'll say it just for you. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},{a:c: {p:1:That this is all truth} } 
Ushiromiya Ange,"{a:c: ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"" } "
,Ange's yell covered up Bern's red truth. 
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!! Stupid kid. If only you hadn't made me say that, you could've shut it up inside the cat box. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"But you just had to ask, right? I knew you would, of course. And I so wanted to see you scream like that. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"...A lovely expression like that should keep me laughing for about a hundred years. ...*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!! Go back to being scrap meat. Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!! "
Ushiromiya Ange,"Mom, Dad, ...it's a lie, right?! Lies, ...lies... ...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh......"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""A-Ange...! Ange...?!"" "
,"As Ange held her head and screamed, the blood dripping from her finally grew so thick that it started scattering all over the place. "
,"Then, bit by bit, her body began to melt...no, to fall apart. Then, bits of her began to pile up on the chair, ...until she was nothing but a pile of guts and scraps... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahah, aaaahhahahahahaaaaahhaahaha!! Is the truth really that sacred? How absurd, how foolish!! "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"Why can't Humans control their own truth? They stupidly search for the truth like that's all that matters, and when they finally find it and can't stand it, they turn themselves into scrap meat!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Hey, are you watching? Clair? ......You wanted to hide this truth too, didn't you? "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"For fun, you wrote several cat box tales... and planned to seal them in message bottles like the end of a mystery novel you loved. Then, you threw them into the sea. To save those who would suffer if they knew this truth...!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You sealed everything in a cat box, and Eva provided the lock. *giggle*giggle*!! And I've sliced that box open for you...!! "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha, all that effort you spent to hide it has gone to waste!! I've exposed all of the truth you hid with your death!! Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahhahha!!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Is that...what you've been after?! You did all of this just to mock Clair's death?!! And then, ...you showed it to Ange to make her suffer...?! You really were...an evil witch after all!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I've been a witch the whole time. A traveler whose only goal is to escape boredom. ...Care for it and love it while it's alive, then eat the guts when it's dead. That's how witches live!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I cannot forgive you for what you've done...!! You've hurt Ange and humiliated Clair, ...the person I would become in another world...!! I won't forgive you...!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Lion, you're still Clair's hope. Even after her death."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""............!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""From the moment Clair got thrown off that cliff, her fate was already sealed. I'm sure she felt a little bit of salvation to know that another ""her"" lives in happiness in another world."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...That's right. I'm her salvation...! So, I must live life to the fullest...for the both of us...!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Lion, ...let me show you just a bit more of this tale of the truth."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I'm not interested!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""No, it'll be very interesting. ...After the duel between Eva and Kyrie, the guesthouse is wrapped in silence. Let me invite you to the parlor at that point in time."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""The parlor...? The one in the mansion?"" "
,"{f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers, and the scene of the mansion's parlor unfolded before them. "
,"In the cruel tale they had just been shown, the parlor hadn't been particularly important. "
,"Jessica had been summoned to the parlor, but she was then immediately led to the dining hall and killed there. "
,"So, there hadn't been anything to see in the parlor. And, in fact, there was nothing to see in the parlor now appearing before Lion. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Just what's supposed to be here?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle* ...As you can see, there's nothing here. But watch. I'm about to show you something interesting."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""If you call it interesting, that's a sure sign that it isn't."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle*giggle* ...Go on, take a look. ...It's right there. Right in that corner."" "
,{f:5:Bernkastel} was pointing...at nothing more than a corner of the room. 
,There was nothing there. 
,"She had told Lion to look there, so the latter was expecting something terrible to be there, ...but there really was nothing there at all. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""............??"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...That's right, there's nothing there. At least, not in this world. But what if we peek into the next Fragment over...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""............?!"" "
,"On the white, blank wall, ...bit by bit, ...a splash of blood seeped into view. "
,"Then, right there, ...a corpse appeared. But...that couldn't be... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Th- This is... ...m- me...?!"" "
,"It was Lion, ...lying dead against the wall... "
,Ushiromiya Lion's corpse lay there exposed... 
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Wh-What's going on here...? Why am I here...? This is supposed to be Clair's world, not mine...! Clair and I can't exist at the same time, right...?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yes, that's right. That's because I just switched worlds, ...switched Fragments. Switched to your world, that is."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...I don't understand!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""It's very simple. They both end the same way. ...*giggle*giggle*!!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I don't get it!! Why should I be dead here?!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""In your world, on October 4th, 1986, Beatrice's funeral was held just before the family conference."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Yes, I know that. And for me, that happened today, a short while ago!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I wonder what will happen between that time and late that night..."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Nothing at all!! The cousins will all play together, and the whole family will have dinner together!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Then comes the family conference after night falls. ......You were going to succeed the Headship when you turned 20, right? Was the entire family satisfied with that, I wonder...?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......I don't know if they were satisfied, but the decision had been made. ...The Head made it himself."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Looks like even you don't really believe they were satisfied. That's it right there. ...Kinzo adored you more than anything, ...so he tried to make an exception and have you succeed the Headship directly. Of course, his children wouldn't have been happy with that."" "
,The siblings objected to having Lion succeed the Headship. 
,"Even Krauss joined in, saying that Lion was still too young. "
,"Then, on the night of the family conference, Kinzo tried proposing a difficult riddle... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Could it be......?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""That's right. The riddle of the epitaph. ......As you can tell by the mechanism set into the chapel, Kinzo thought up the epitaph trick near the beginning, when the mansion on Rokkenjima was being built. ...He had the romantic idea of someday using it as a test to select his successor."" "
,Kinzo decided to present that riddle at the family conference. 
,Did he plan to give the position of Successor to the person who solved it? Or did he promise to reconsider Lion's position as the Successor if it was solved? 
,"Either way, Kinzo was confident. "
,"He was confident that no one would be able to solve this tough riddle, which he had created himself. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""After that, everything happened exactly like the truth you just saw. The siblings solved it right away, and there was a quarrel over the pile of gold. *giggle*... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"Then, Kyrie and Rudolf decided to prevent any chance of the crime being discovered the next morning and an outcry being raised... by committing murder late that night. ......They used the phone to call the kids out from the cousin room one by one, then killed them."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...As the first of the cousins, you were the first to be called out. Then, Kyrie shot you dead right here in the parlor."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...No, that's not quite right. You're the Ushiromiya Lion from the early evening of October 4th, 1986. So, I'll say it this way. ...Tonight, Kyrie will shoot you dead in the parlor."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""That's......insane... It's... That's right, probability! "
Ushiromiya Lion,"Just like Lion can be born from Clair thanks to a rare miracle, Aunt Kyrie only commits murder with a tiny probability, close to zero! That must be it! Aren't you the witch who specializes in finding extremely improbable worlds?!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""That is correct. I had to find one Fragment out of 2,578,917 in order to discover the miracle that is you. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"...However, it was very, very easy to find this result for your world. After all, probability isn't a factor. ...I'm a witch who can find any miracle, no matter how unlikely it is."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""But I can't find things that don't exist. ...If the Witch of Certainty really guarantees that something is certain, even I can't win against her."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""But... ...then... ...I'm......"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""With a 2,578,916 out of 2,578,917 probability, you live in the world where you're Clair, get toyed with by an inescapable fate, and reach a tragic end. And, with a 1 out of 2,578,917 probability, you live as Ushiromiya Lion... and are killed by Kyrie tonight."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...In other words, your fate...no, the fate the two of you share... traps you in an inescapable dead end, a hell of fate, with a 2,578,917 out of 2,578,917 probability. To put it another way, it's a certain fate, with absolutely no chance for a miracle! "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"*giggle*, eheheheheheheheheheh!! Sucks for you, Clair. Or should I say, {f:5:Beatrice}."" "
,"Just when a bright light seemed to turn the world white, the scene suddenly changed back to the theater. "
,"On the stage, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s reaper scythe slid across Clair's stomach as the latter stood absolutely still. "
,"A red line was drawn across the white skin, exposed now that the dress had been cut, and black blood began to seep out... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""{f:5:Beatrice}. Trapped in that inescapable, certain, locked-away pair of days, you became a witch who could give birth to endless possibilities within that two-day cat box. ...In exchange, it was absolutely certain that you would not be saved or rewarded. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"However, you had a dream. ...You dreamed of Ushiromiya Lion. ...You consoled yourself with the thought of a miracle world, where you could've lived in happiness without ever becoming Clair!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I had to work hard to find Lion. Just as Beato dreamed, Lion's existence is a true miracle. And, at the end of your funeral, I wanted to show you. ...To show you that, even with that miracle, you couldn't have escaped from tragedy!!"" "
,"Through the small crack between the bars of the jail that imprisoned her, the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} dreamed of a world where she might have been happy... "
,"However, the space she could see through that crack in the bars... was just another part of the same jail... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""The more I hear, ...the less I understand about you...! Why...would you do something like this...?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I lost a game to {f:5:Beatrice}, so I wanted to get back at her. ...*giggle*giggle*!! Yeah, now I feel a lot better about losing that game...! Hey, Beato, are you watching? Can you see this?! And do you remember? Remember when I promised you that a miracle wouldn't occur, with certainty?!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ahhahahahahahahah, ahhahahahahaahahahahahahahaha!! So, Lion! Allow me to return you to your world, right before Beato's eyes!! "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"It looks like the theatergoing witches are all sick and tired of those happy family get-together scenes. So, I'll send you to the moment just before Kyrie shoots you! Then, I'll make Beato watch that moment!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahaha!! Die, scum Lion! The last hope of that scum Beato, uhyahhahhyaahhaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"" "
,"{f:5:Bernkastel} raised her reaper scythe, ...swung it down with gusto, ...and plunged it deep into Clair's stomach... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Did you think you'd get an easy death? Hehihihihihihihi!! But humiliating and tearing out a corpse's guts is my specialty...!!"" "
,"She took the blade end of the scythe and heartlessly, ruthlessly, brutally...raised it up into the air. "
,"...Along a vertical line from Clair's stomach to her chest, ...the blade cut deeply, ...slicing Clair open. "
,"The red-black insides... jutted out, ...then burst like a dam breaking, covering the world with dark red entrails... "
,"""S-Steal the Italians' gold, you say? You coward, Ushiromiya! And you call yourself a soldier of the Empire?!!"" "
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...F-Father...? I-I do love and respect you, Father... B-But...your feelings are something I, ummm..."" "
,"""Why...?!! Why did you save me?! Why didn't you let me die?! Because of that terrible injury, ...I've been forced to live in a body like this!! I never wanted to live in a body like this!! "
,"This body that isn't even capable of love...!! What's...what's the point in living like that?! This isn't a Human's life...!! It's like being furniture!!"" "
,"""That's right, I'm...furniture...!! Furniture...!! Why...why didn't you let me die back then?!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!!!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Huh-"" "
,"When I came to, ...I was in the parlor of the mansion. "
,When did I get here? 
,"...I heard a sound behind me, then slowly turned around... "
,And there...... 
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Sorry. Please don't take this personally."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Huh-"" "
,I could see down the frigid barrel of the gun Aunt Kyrie was pointing. 
,"Then, ...she slowly... ...pulled the trigger... "
,"I could feel a razor-sharp wind pass through my body, like a knife slicing through butter. "
,"...Prepared for death, and hoping to see my fate until the end, I slowly opened my eyes... "
,...The world had been cut in two. 
,"Kyrie was frozen in place like a statue, still pointing her gun with a cold smile on her face... ...and had been cut in half at an angle, the top part of her slowly sliding off to the side. "
,"No, that wasn't quite right. That wasn't right at all. "
,It wasn't just Kyrie. The whole world had been sliced in half at an angle...and was slowly sliding off to one side. 
,"Then, immediately after fissures seemed to appear across the world, it shattered. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......?! ...Y-You...!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""...When you own a cat, you tend to pick up their habits."" "
,"He pointed at {f:5:Bernkastel} with the tip of the pitch-black sword that had sliced the world, glaring at her. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle*giggle*... ...What's this? Are you saying you came back here on a whim...?"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""...There was no way you'd end things on a happy note. Do you really hate {f:5:Beatrice} so much?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You think I'd let her win and get away...? I have to pay her back in full for the humiliation she caused me. When I hold a grudge, a mere century isn't long enough for me to forget it."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""You're a gloomy person."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Come on, you mustn't neglect my heart. ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Are you okay, Lion? ......Hey, what's wrong?!"" "
,"Lion had suddenly doubled over, groaning. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......My chest... ...hurts... ...It's..."" "
,Will roughly grabbed the hand that was pressed against Lion's chest and tore it away. 
,Blood was seeping out from where Lion's hand had been. 
,...It was the place that the bullet would have entered if Kyrie had shot Lion. 
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle* ...Looks like Lion's body is almost ready to accept its fate."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Lion, hang in there! ...Damn these chains...!"" "
,"When Will tried to pick Lion's body up, he finally noticed the chains attached to each wrist and ankle. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""What's this? Are you trying to take that kid and escape? I won't let you. I'm about to let everyone watch as Lion coughs up blood, despairing at the fact that there's no hope in any of the many worlds, before finally dying in agony."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Lion isn't a show."" "
,Will swung his pitch-black sword and destroyed the chains binding Lion. 
,"The chains and shackles shattered into little bits like glass, ...then vanished. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You intend to get in the way of my fun...?"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""You aren't God. All you can do is sneer at fate. ...Lion's fate is gonna be decided by Lion. You can't treat a human's fate like a toy."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......*giggle*giggle* Hahhahahhahahahahahahahaha...!! You've got guts, saying that to the great {f:5:Bernkastel}, witch of the Senate! I have no more use for you either, get it...?"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You've shown that Beato's fantasy is a mystery and cut it to pieces. You've fulfilled your role. I would've let you be, if only you'd just left quietly. Now that you've strolled back in here, you can hardly complain if I make you my plaything."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Come to me, my cute kitties. ...Scratch them up and tear off their skin. Peel them like grapes...!"" "
,"When {f:5:Bernkastel} clapped her hands twice, countless pairs of glaring jewels appeared all around Will and Lion. "
,"They were clearly cat eyes, but the way the drool hung from their mouths looked far more terrifying than any cat... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Will... ...Aahhnn..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""I'll handle this. Trimming kitty nails is nothing new to me."" "
,The number of jewels surrounding them already reached into the thousands. 
,"Will pointed his sword in one direction after another, warding off the surrounding cats... "
Willard H. Wright,"""Get a grip, Lion. You haven't been shot. Don't acknowledge that you have been...no, that you're going to be shot...!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Nngggghhh..."" "
,Lion tried to fight an incredible tearing pain. 
,"No, ...it was a fight against the promised future that {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown. "
,"However, the stake of that future, which the Witch of Miracles had guaranteed would contain no miracle, was firm and merciless... "
,"Bit by bit, and yet unceasingly, it continued to pierce into Lion's chest... "
Willard H. Wright,"""...Listen up. ...I'm going to break through their perimeter for just a second. When I do, you need to run with all you've got. It doesn't matter where. Just make sure you get far away from this place, and keep on running no matter what happens."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......I'll try... to the best of my ability... ...If I can't do it, ...please forgive me..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""...If you can't do it? Enough whining. I won't forgive you. Neither will Clair. "
Willard H. Wright,"...Did you forget that you're Clair's 1 in 2,578,917 chance? If you give up, you're betraying all the other ""yous"" in countless worlds...!! So don't lose heart! Keep on struggling and struggling...!! Don't look for a miracle... Be one!!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Be...a miracle..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""You're going to reach a happy future. Don't give up, don't complain. Just you try complaining again. This time I'll pinch your ass...!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......O-Okay..."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhahha!! How very confident you are, telling this kid to be a miracle when you stand before the Witch of Miracles...! Miracles are no more than fantasy! Grovel in this world that has been convicted as a mystery, and die horribly like a worm! The witches of theatergoing are looking forward to watching it!!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""...Hmph. You call that mystery? You think I'd ever accept a mystery without heart? Let the cat who wants to be made into a shamisen strike first."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Aah, what a pain. Let's have all of you at once! I'm Willard H. Wright, SSVD's Head Inquisitor of Heresy. This will be the final time I draw my sword...!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Trash him, kitties."" "
,"At once, all of the cat eyes opened wide, undulating and spinning in a spiral, then swallowed Will up. "
,But Will and Lion weren't swallowed up. 
,"The cats that had flown in at them from all directions were now being launched away, like they were a balloon popping around the pair. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Oh, not bad."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""I don't give a damn about your kitties. It's just the mama cat I care about. ......{f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles!! It's about time someone trimmed your claws!!"" "
,Another flash of the black blade spun in a dark tornado and scattered the cats once more. 
,"Lion, realizing that this was the opening Will had planned, ran all out, still clutching at a heaving chest. "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Will, ...I'm running!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Diana has a weak stomach. Make sure you only give her milk that's warm."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Huh?"" "
,"By the time Lion asked Will to repeat what he had said, he had already leapt onto the stage and was now confronting {f:5:Bernkastel}. "
,It was like the climax of a show. ...Loud cheers erupted from the pitch-black audience seating. 
,"On either side of Clair, who lay with her insides exposed, ...stood Will, with his pitch-black sword, and {f:5:Bernkastel}, with the scythe that could harvest miracles from fate. "
Willard H. Wright,"""Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits, and they massacred the people on the island? They called Lion out to the parlor, then shot Lion to death? Sorry, but I can't acknowledge this ""truth"" of yours as a mystery. This is all fantasy."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Fantasy? You're calling it that to try and let Lion escape fate? By all means, try. *cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!! Ahhhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha, hiiyaaaaaaahhaaaaaaaahhh!!!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented.}"" "
,"...Surely, Will's black sword must have cut through {f:5:Bernkastel}'s body. "
,"However, it had no effect, ...like cutting the reflection of the moon on the water. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""What's this? What do you mean by ""clues""?"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""I won't accept your ""mystery"" with Kyrie and Rudolf as the culprits. ...You won't find clues showing that they're the culprits no matter which game you look at."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Of course you won't. Even if they did exist at one point, the whole island blew up."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Which means there aren't any clues. And that means this is no mystery. It's fantasy."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Huuh...?"" "
,It's impossible for an unprovable truth to become truth in the Human world. 
,"In other words, even the actual truth cannot cross the boundary of a cat box. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! Are you trying to shut the truth inside the cat box? *giggle*giggle* Is this how the mystery genre is supposed to fight? Ahhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha! Hiiyahhhahahahahahaaaaaaaaahhh!!"" "
,"With a laugh like the howl of a wild animal, {f:5:Bernkastel} carelessly tossed her scythe aside. "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Fighting itself is a waste of time. Get over here, scum. Try and cut me all you like. I'll listen to all you've got to say."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""...The twenty wedges will pierce every part of your heartless mystery. Here it comes."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""And when you realize that you can't defeat me with those twenty wedges, ...you know what'll happen next, right? *giggle* Come on. I'll play with you, ...if that's what you want!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"" "
,"Trying to ignore an incredible pain in the chest, ...Lion kept on running and running without stopping. "
,"I dashed out of the theater of the theatergoing witches, then ran through an incomprehensible world of blackness. "
,"Before I knew it, I was running through a place that looked like a sea of stars, ...or maybe the bottom of the ocean with stars scattered around. "
,"If I get careless for a second, I'll probably trip. "
,"No, if I get careless, I won't be able to tell if I'm running... or just making running motions as I free fall, endlessly sinking deeper into the ocean of stars. "
,"I just kept on running, without any goal or target. "
,I mustn't stop moving. I mustn't fall down here. 
,"If I fall, ...I'll crush the hope of the 'me's in countless worlds... "
,There's a happy world that the {f:5:Beatrice}s dreamed of. 
,"And I'm their last hope, the only one who can reach that world... "
,"...Even though I understand this, ...the ""truth"" thrust in front of me by the witch who controls miracles, who says there can be no miracle, is cruelly gouging itself into my chest... "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...... ...Sorry, ...Will... ...My body's...already......"" "
,"Then, Lion finally... ...succumbed to the fierce pain and fate... ...and fell over... "
,Lion's body was held roughly from behind and lifted up. 
Ushiromiya Lion,""".........!! ...W-Will...!! You're okay...!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""No, not really. ...Don't you give up. Didn't I tell you I'd pinch your ass?"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Sorry... ...I'm really sorry... ...But... on that day, in that place, I was fated to be killed..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""That's right. All humans are fated to die in the end. Does that mean their lives are meaningless? "
Willard H. Wright,"Of course not. What a person's life means, what it's worth, what it is...these are things each person decides for themselves. ...No matter what sort of fate is forced upon them. Don't accept it. Create your own world...for yourself...!"" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Will, ...your...left arm...!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Ah, right... Must have forgotten it. It'd be a pain to go back and get it now."" "
,There were rips all over Will's body. 
,"Also, his left arm had been brutally torn off from the elbow, his clothes were in tatters, ...and he looked like a bloodstained scarecrow... "
,"Then, Lion noticed. "
,"Though this place had once felt like a sea filled with stars, both above and below them, ...those stars had now gathered together and were surrounding them... "
,"It was a huge, even number of stars, all glaring at the two of them... "
,"Will was holding Lion with one arm. He couldn't take his sword out. However, he didn't let go. "
,"...He was determined to let Lion escape from here, to lead Lion towards the happy tale that the {f:5:Beatrice}s had dreamed of. "
,"Behind the cats whose eyes glowed out of the empty darkness, ...the queen of cats who permitted no miracles appeared... "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Willard, put Lion down. If you do, I'll let you go."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Go file a protest with the Great Court. You can put it up for debate."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Will, ...I..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""I won't leave you behind. ...I need to tell you. To tell you why I quit SSVD."" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Come to think of it, even I don't know that. ...Why'd you do it?"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""It's because I got fed up with all those damn sob story mysteries. ...We'll survive and reach a happy ending."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""I'll show her. {f:5:Beatrice} died in despair, thinking that there were only bad endings. I'll show her that a happy ending can exist. That's why I'll never put you down."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Will..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""You can take the rest of my left arm, cats. I'll give you my legs too, if you want them. ...But I'm not letting go of Lion here. ...I'll take Lion away from the bad ending you represent, even if I have to crawl my way out of here...!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Are you okay with this, Lion? Will's planning to die protecting you. You don't want that, right? Go ahead and tell him to leave you be and save himself."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Will..."" "
Willard H. Wright,"""Yeah."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""...Please, ...don't leave me here...! ...I'll certainly survive! And so will you...!!"" "
Willard H. Wright,"""That's the spirit."" "
,"As he said this, Will held Lion tight. "
Willard H. Wright,"""There you have it. We'll keep struggling on, {f:5:Bernkastel}."" "
Ushiromiya Lion,"""We won't give up on the chance of a miracle...!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You're saying that? When the Witch of Miracles has promised with certainty that there will be no miracles? ......*giggle*giggle* Hehehehehehahahahahahaha!! So long, you two. Go collect dust in the depths of oblivion, unable even to die, and disappear!!"" "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Come, my kitties. I won't order you to kill them. Just clean up the two pieces whose role has ended."" "
,"A hundred million, a trillion, ten quadrillion cats all bared their fangs. "
,"In the starry sky of cat eyes, countless flesh-colored mouths opened, exposing countless teeth. "
,{a:c:...The world was wrapped in flesh and blood and fangs.}
