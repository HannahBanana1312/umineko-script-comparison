{f:5:Beatrice},"""...What sort of tea should I prepare next? You have free choice of any brand that ever was throughout the ages."""
,"""......Dried plum tea. ......Those dried plums that go for 200 yen a pack."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*...! ...For a thousand years I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing. ...I will never tire of living in this world."""
,"""...............Beato. You don't have to display such hostility. ...I am just a wandering witch. I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...*cackle*cackle*, there is not even a sliver of hostility. ...I am just terribly concerned about seeing that the legendary witch, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, is well attended to."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........You misunderstand. I am powerless. Before a witch such as you, with the dreadful power to kill a person a hundred times over, I am completely powerless."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That a ""powerless"" witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying. After all, you fended off that Great Witch, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as a lone piece."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I only won an endurance contest. She simply got tired."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is not what Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} said, though. ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, too much humility can be unseemly, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......That girl has a dreadful power. ............The power to kill a person ""without fail"". However, there is no such thing as ""without fail"" in this world. Just as, no matter how many times you divide 1, you can never make it 0."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""That girl has the power to bring that closer and closer to ""virtually zero"", and give rise to a ""virtually absolute certainty"". ......I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However, you have a power that manifests without fail ""except for zero"". ......Although you say there is no such thing as ""without fail"" in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself. ......How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......The power to kill a person ""endlessly""... ...I think you're the more terrifying one."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Such jests. ......From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power. The phrase ""flattery will get you nowhere"" was made for this situation."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Call it payment for my stay here. ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the {ruby:kakera:fragments}, continually running from boredom. ......I simply came around because I'd heard that you'd started something interesting. Rest assured, I will leave of my own accord as soon as you start to bore me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*...! I am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as an observer. *cackle*cackle*! And so, your impression?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............{f:5:Lambdadelta} is terrifying because of her cruelty; however, she was a girl I could understand. ...You do seem to possess affection, but I can't understand you at all. That's why you're much more terrifying than her."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! I am fickle by nature. Do forgive me. ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy trusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice—is that not so, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get. Unlike you. You, on the other hand, anticipate all outcomes."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""And, whatever the roll might be, you're never disappointed. Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied ""without fail"". .........In that sense, you far surpass me."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........You're one I really don't want to fight with. Inside of you, there's nothing but zero. That's why I can't win against you with my power. ...The worst matchup. ......Perhaps {f:5:Lambdadelta}, on the other hand, has a good matchup against you. Since she would likely be able to kill your ""endlessness""."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*! ......Truly, tea is best drunk in the company of a witch. It's never boring. *cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Good to hear. Boredom is the sole poison that can kill me. ......So, don't kill me, alright? Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, Endless Witch."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If such is your wish, I shall show you an even better time."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away? It seems that the next tale would do more for you than a refill of tea."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""................................."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Just wait for a moment. ......*cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},............Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"I'd really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad matchup. Unfortunately for you."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"First of all, about that girl."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"She does have an existence that goes by the name of {f:5:Beatrice}, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she is ""a woman with an individual body""."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"Do you understand what I mean? In other words, she's not some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}. Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them."
{f:5:Bernkastel},This can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a few games.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"First, take a good look over the chessboard.{n}And notice the movements and roles of the pieces.{n}Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"When you've managed to reveal all of these things, her heart will be exposed.{n}After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......I am being quite generous. Back when I was once human, it took me a hundred years to realize even this much."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It is like a single spoon."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.{n}You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal prison."
{f:5:Bernkastel},......Don't get the wrong idea—I have no intention of becoming your ally.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.{n}...It's like how someone sitting in front of a television cannot reach the characters on screen no matter how much they yell at them."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"{a:c:THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL I AM A WITCH, YOU SEE?}"
{f:5:Bernkastel},I intend to enjoy the endless tales that Beato is going to weave until I tire of them. But I'm sure that alone won't hold my interest.
{f:5:Bernkastel},......That's why I'll lend you my power. It's all so that I don't get tired of this.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"I am the cruelest witch in the world.{n}No matter who the opponent may be, I'll absolutely make them surrender."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"...Even if that's {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch..."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"You are my game piece. Give it your best shot.{n}I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"Don't bore me, okay......?"
{f:5:Bernkastel},*giggle*giggle*giggle*......
