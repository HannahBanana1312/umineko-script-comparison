{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Erika, Dlanor."""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, my master."""
Dlanor,"""You {f:5:called}?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I want you two to stay in this fragment......and explain everything in the remaining first through fourth games. That pitiful transient witch no longer exists to assert her witch illusions. Expose the naked truth with extreme prejudice."""
Furudo Erika,"""*giggle*! Leave it to me, my master. There is no mystery that Furudo Erika cannot solve."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Of course. That's why you're my piece, my double. *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"""
,"{f:5:Bernkastel} wore a massive...and horrible smile, which Erika shared."
,"......{f:5:Beatrice}'s witch illusions would disappear, and the results of all of the previous games would be painted over."
,"It had been crushed in every way possible, ......and only the naked truth remained."
,"To Erika, such a weak truth might as well have been fish on a chopping board..."
Furudo Erika,"""All four prior games...can be explained as either Natsuhi's crimes or freak exceptions. I won't let anyone talk about them as the crimes of some witch called {f:5:Beatrice} again. I'll start compiling it together at once and present you a first‐rate tale."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle*...... You mustn't leave even a single fragment of Beato's Legend of the Witch behind. The rumors among the servants, the way people talked about unexplained events as though a witch was the cause, the witch illusions used alongside the illusion of Kinzo. ......Deal with all of them completely."""
Furudo Erika,"""Of course. I'll get to it right away. ......We currently have the furniture in custody. We're hurrying to identify their vessels."""
,The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had already been taken into custody.
,Those noisy sisters who had served Beato now faced nothing but denial.
,"What sort of fantasy were they based upon which allowed them to ""manifest""?"
,......Everything would be exposed......and denied.
Dlanor,"""Eiserne Jungfrau has already begun its {f:5:investigation}. Our most recent findings indicate that there is a high probability they were produced during the 1960's in New York or somewhere {f:5:nearby}. An aide has already been sent to the {f:5:location}."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""The 1960's? The Seven Sisters of Purgatory are <Made in USA>? Pfft, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...... Even though they bragged about being furniture connected with King Solomon and serving a thousand year old witch, they're a total sham. So what are they...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""According to the report, there's this group of big‐time swindlers......who make money by selling high‐priced imitation goods to rich fans of the occult."""
Dlanor,"""The deceived millionaires resell the articles with invented histories, and this may have caused the items to become falsely deified among {f:5:collectors}. We are rushing to find confirmation and further {f:5:details}."""
Furudo Erika,"""Ushiromiya Kinzo was apparently a big customer of theirs who'd pay exorbitant sums for the most blatantly fake objects."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......*giggle*giggle*, ...ahahahahahahahaha...!! And that's what the Seven Sisters of Purgatory really are...? That's ridiculous, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahha!! A total sham, just what I'd expect from one of Beato's witch illusions."""
Furudo Erika,"""So despite calling themselves the seven deadly sins, they're actually cheap, fake souvenirs. ......Of course, from the first time I saw them, I figured they were nothing more than paperweights sold at some shady souvenir shop."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""*giggle*giggle*!! Paperweights...! Ahhah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!! Have you confronted the Seven Sisters with that truth yet?"""
Dlanor,"""No, not {f:5:yet}."""
Furudo Erika,"""They still seriously believe...that they were created by a great magician over a thousand years ago. ......I can't wait to thrust the truth and perfect evidence in their faces...and let them know that they're mere paperweights worth less than 30 US dollars."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I wonder what kind of expressions will register on their faces as they lose all hope? ......*giggle*, I can't wait. Call me when you do it. I'll come to watch, with some of the best black tea and dried plums."""
,"Beato's witch illusions had already been seen through, and it had been proven that every one of them was simply the result of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} fantasy."
,What kind of fantasies created them and what was their basis?{n}The illusions would be confronted with this perfectly proven truth...
,"......And at that time, they would disperse like smoke and be completely annihilated."
,This was called......“execution”.
Dlanor,"""......An execution is not a {f:5:show}. As a general rule, it is not open to the {f:5:public}."""
Furudo Erika,"""This is an inspection by the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, member of the Senate, so she can observe that the Great Court is performing its duties satisfactorily. Do you, a mere Inquisitor, intend to obstruct this...?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yes, that's right. I'm just observing as a representative of the Senate to make sure you observe the proper procedures when you carry out your work. ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*."""
Furudo Erika,"""We are currently preparing to take {f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove, and Gaap into custody as well. The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards are conducting that investigation."""
Furudo Erika,""".........Of course, after that is done, we will then detain and execute the three Chiester Sisters, who are also connected to {f:5:Beatrice}."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Dlanor, what is the true nature of the Chiester Sisters?"""
Dlanor,"""......We believe there is a high likelihood that their vessels are weapons used in the {f:5:crimes}. My senior aide, Gertrude, has formed a dedicated {f:5:team}. We are currently investigating their individual {f:5:cases}."""
Furudo Erika,"""I'm looking forward to the Chiester Sisters' execution too...! One at a time? Or all of them at once?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""No one's stupid enough to empty the entire can of tea leaves into the pot at once. You've got to enjoy it slowly, one spoonful at a time."""
Furudo Erika,"""*giggle*giggle*! Exactly. Let's hold their executions on consecutive days. One for each witch and piece of furniture. I'll present you with a new execution show every day."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Wonderful. .........After all, there really are a lot of them. Looks like we'll be able to enjoy ourselves for a full two weeks."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Maybe we could let them decide among themselves which of them to execute first. Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh! Make sure you think up something great for the execution concepts. ......I'd like to enjoy executions both old and new from East and West every day."""
Dlanor,"""......The rules state that the method of execution is to follow Great Court {f:5:regulations}."""
Furudo Erika,"""Leave it to me, my master. I will most certainly prepare you a fascinating execution show!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I expect quartering at the very least."""
Furudo Erika,"""Of course. I shall make a list of the highest forms of execution from countries across the world from Europe to Asia, which were used by kingdoms East and West for nothing less than treason against the king!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I'd like to propose an execution method myself. ...Pondering that will be the perfect way to relax on those sleepless nights. ......*giggle*. I'll come up with an idea and send you a letter soon."""
Furudo Erika,"""Certainly, my master. Then we'll use the {f:5:Bernkastel}‐style execution for the grand finale. ......At the very, very end, when all of the illusions have been broken and Beato's system of magic has been completely crushed, ...I shall present you with the finest execution you desire...at the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}...!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Thank you, Erika. ......Thanks to you, it seems I'll be able to forget the pain of my illness for a little while...... *giggle*giggle*, hehe{0}he{0}he{0}heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha! You're just perfect. My piece, my double, ......and my precious daughter."""
Furudo Erika,"""Y‐......your words are too good for me...! My master...!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Erika, I will give you honor and a reward. ......Beato's greatest symbol, the portrait in the reception hall. Take it down, smash it to make firewood, bake a cake over that fire and eat it. Then you have my permission to put your own portrait up in the empty frame."""
Furudo Erika,"""...Th‐......thank you very much...! It is the greatest of honors...!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........You will eradicate and erase {f:5:Beatrice}'s name and all traces of her. Until that is all finished, I order you to become the master of this sealed‐off Rokkenjima."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......By the name of the Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}, I hereby grant you the rank of witch until that day arrives. ......From now on, you will call yourself {f:5:Erika}, Witch of Truth."""
Furudo Erika,"""W‐......Witch...of Truth......! ......Th‐......thank you very much, my master...!! I vow to work even harder so that this honor is not wasted...!"""
,"Even though she was nothing more than a piece, .........she was being granted the honor of calling herself a witch like her master, if only for a brief stretch of time......"
,Erika was so moved at having her hard work acknowledged in this greatest form that she trembled......
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Dlanor, continue to aid {f:5:Erika}...and report on her progress to me."""
Dlanor,"""......As you {f:5:wish}."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............By the way, where's Lambda?"""
Dlanor,"""She is over {f:5:there}."""
,"From the guest seating on the second floor, she pointed downwards."
,"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.........could be seen beneath Battler, who hung there dead, run through by the red longsword."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},""".........Ushiromiya Battler... You were an interesting guy. ...You could have been so much more interesting...... Such a shame."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I think it was a wonderful way to die. .........{f:5:Erika}! You can hang Battler's corpse in the mansion's reception hall. ......The next time I come to visit this fragment, welcome me in front of it."""
Furudo Erika,"""Certainly, my master. I'll make that foolish man an eternal monument to your victory!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""*giggle*, that sounds wonderful. Super stylish. Maybe you can coat him with plaster and make a beautiful white statue. ......And it'd be even better if you decorated him all cute!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. I will strive to answer your expectations...!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Grats on your witch promotion. Even though it's only temporary, I welcome you as a friend."""
,Erika was so overcome with emotion that tears came to her eyes.
,.........Because no greater pleasure exists for a piece than having its efforts acknowledged by its master.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""In the end, I'd like to have Beato stuffed too. Then I'll have her displayed on high in the reception hall."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Lake Shirakaba?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""The {c:86EF9C:{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}‐hunting Count}."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""......You know, I read that back when I wasn't a witch. ...I wondered, how can humans who obtain eternal life become so cruel? I always found that strange. ......At the time, I honestly couldn't relate."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........After becoming a witch and living a thousand years, I fully understand it. ......That writer could understand our cruelty really well, in the truest sense. *giggle*giggle*!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""......Where to next? I guess we'll go off in opposite directions like always?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Only because I don't want to bore you."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Thanks, Bern. But you can be sure that I'll count to a hundred and then start searching for you again."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You never let me get bored, do you? That's why I like you, love you. ............Let's meet again somewhere. Of course, that might be a hundred or a thousand years from now...or never again for all eternity."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""It'll work out. The sea of fragments is tiny to a pair who love each other."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""The Third Man?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""No, Children of Paradise, of course."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........If each time you smashed one of those countless fragments that glitter like a starry night, you could escape the poison of just a single evening's worth of boredom, even you would want to count the stars in the sky."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ooh, not bad...pfft, *giggle*giggle*...!"""
,"The witches known as Voyagers travel across the countless glittering futures of possibility, ......and gobble them up, trying to escape their illness called boredom for as long as they can."
,"The tiny, tiny fragment created by the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} known as {f:5:Beatrice}......had now been gobbled up by the two witches......and had lost its glitter."
,The two who had earlier called themselves rivals in front of Beato...now stopped that charade and laughed together playfully.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""{f:5:Erika}. The new ruler of this fragment. .........Weave the truth, ......and create the tale that leads up to this world's demise. ...Umm, the next was the sixth game, right?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, it's the sixth game."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Decide the title for Episode 6 yourself. After all, you're already the spinner of this tale, as well as its Master."""
Furudo Erika,"""Thank you very much. ......Actually, I've already decided on one."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Oh, already? ......Then let me hear it. What's the title?"""
Furudo Erika,"""It is...Episode 6.........heheheheh, actually, I'd like to tease you a bit, but I'll tell you."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""*giggle*! Come on, stop being a smartass and tell us. A newbie witch like you shouldn't be teasing your seniors!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Episode 6: Checkmate of the Golden Witch!"""
