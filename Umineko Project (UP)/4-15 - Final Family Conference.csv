Speaker,Umineko Project (UP)
Ushiromiya Jessica,""".........A test......?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......M‐mm. Listen well..."""
,"Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse."
,......And the message was......that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to be the next head.
Ushiromiya Krauss,""".........The head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings, that he wants to......pick from you grandchildren..."""
,"From Krauss's restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak."
,"And she was forced into the realization that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now, and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed."
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""S‐......so......what should we do?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......M‐...mm. Hold on..."""
,"Krauss held the receiver away from his ear, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars."
,Kinzo gave his next order.
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Before the test, those unrelated must be removed. .........Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe? It will be a problem if they interfere with the test. Banish them from the guesthouse."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,""".........Banish, ...you say......?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden. Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there. Hmm, we'll begin from there. Tell them to do it immediately."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........My weapons will be watching. Should they do anything questionable, I'll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......I, ......I understand...... ......Hello, Jessica... Listen closely to what I'm going to tell you......"""
,Krauss relayed to Jessica the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa......
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......What kind of test are you planning?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmm? Aah, it truly is a simple test. I will simply have my grandchildren show me their resolve. Well now, I wonder what kind of results they'll show me. ......Hehehahahah."""
,"With displeasure, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children..."
,"......It's regrettable, but for now we can't refuse orders."
,"In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won't amount to anything."
,"If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us, there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer."
,"......For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him, all the while waiting for a chance......"
,"However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands, the children might be attacked in this so‐called test, and they might even lose their lives."
,".........Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ......nothing will cause the situation to improve."
,"Anyway, keeping our eyes peeled so that we don't let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now."
,"......While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo's orders......"
Nanjo Terumasa,""".........Kyrie‐san. Let us be patient......"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I know. ......It's unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait. If we can just do something about these bars, we'll be able to get back to the mansion......"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......If only we could somehow get out of here... ......I‐I'll try something. ...............Kinzo‐san, I have a request."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hm, what is it, my friend?"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""We understand well that you want to test the children... ......It is fine for you to do things as you desire."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have collapsed long ago. We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge. Besides, that is what the family conference is about. We won't get in your way..."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmm. I am glad to have your understanding. That's right, this is the family conference. The final family conference, where I will select and finalize the next head. Fuhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""So, the thing is, Kinzo‐san... ......It is far too cold here. We won't interfere with your test, so couldn't you take us to a slightly warmer place......?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".................."""
,"At Nanjo's words, the slight signs that Kinzo's mood had been improving were blown away."
,"A moment of silence struck Nanjo as Kinzo glared at him with dangerous eyes, as though evaluating him......"
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Certainly, this place is cold. It's tough on an old body. ......My lord. Wouldn't it be alright if we moved them upstairs......?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""That is not happening!! I don't think so, Nanjoooooo... I know how truly elegantly you lay the foundations for future moves as you appear to give me a turn's breathing room. I'm not falling for that, ohhhhhh noooo... If you insist you're freezing, then I will line the floor with red‐hot coals!!"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""M‐my apologies......"""
,"{f:5:Virgilia} had tried to help out too, but in the end, Kinzo was having none of it..."
Gaap,"""...............You two sure are obedient. ...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars."""
Kanon,"""..........................."""
Shannon,"""......Even if we break these, nothing will come of it."""
Gaap,"""True. ......If you were to break these, it would mean the end of {f:5:Goldsmith}'s game. ......All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo's ritual."""
Gaap,"""......But, you know, you two might be the only ones. Who hold the power to break through this situation......right?"""
Gaap,""".........You want to reach the Golden Land, don't you? You must have many dreams you want granted, right...? *chuckle*......"""
Kanon,""".............................."""
Ronove,"""Gaap. You mustn't provoke them. ......This is not your game. It is the Master's game, and Milady's."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........What is it, Ronove?"""
Gaap,"""Oh, no, nothing. ......We were chatting with the prisoners. Forgive us."""
,"Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away."
,Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists......
Kanon,"""..................... ......Dammit........."""
Shannon,"""......Well done...... Good job holding it in......"""
Kanon,"""We're powerless...... Because we're furniture......"""
Shannon,"""That's right, ......we're powerless. ......But there are times when furniture is needed, and even loved."""
Shannon,"""......We're stored away in the basement right now, that's all. ......I'm sure that one day, somebody will love us. Need us. ......So, for now, let's ignore their provocations and bear with it... ......Okay?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Father. I've ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Good. You may hang up now. ......Chiester Sisters. Observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away. If they do anything suspicious, ......then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over."""
,"When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line."
Chiester00,"""Understood, sir. ......I will scout. {ruby:Five‐five‐six:556} and 410, cover both flanks. 45, wide‐area surveillance."""
Chiester45,"""00... 556 is......"""
Chiester00,"""Ah, ............that's right. Sorry."""
Chiester45,"""She was a good kid......"""
Chiester410,"""......That's why I don't like them nyeh. ...Good people."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?! Carry out my orders!"""
Chiester00,"""...............My apologies, sir. Then, let us go observe. ......Move out!"""
,The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously.
,"Nanjo and Kyrie witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation, but they interpreted this as if they had probably moved in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation, and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes..."
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Well then. I shall begin preparing for the test. Ronove, Gaap. I'm asking you to be the examiners. {f:5:Virgilia}, you watch these rats. .........After all, two of my furniture are here. Just in case, be on your guard."""
,"He glanced sharply at Shannon and Kanon. Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow, answering wordlessly that she would not cause any trouble......"
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Certainly. I'll be careful."""
Gaap,"""Isn't this cold hard on your old body, Lia? Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Shut up. Hurry up and go. Gap."""
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku ku...! Well, well, tests and examiners, what a strange experience we have this game. .........I do hope this development entertains Milady."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Come, arise, goat attendants."""
,"{f:5:Virgilia} called out into the dark, and from that spot, three massive goat‐headed attendants slowly melted into vision."
Gaap,"""Ah, Riiche's minions. How useful. And they look so warm. I see, so this is instead of a hot water bottle. In that case, wouldn't sheep have been better than goats?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Shut up about it, you cashmere mop. ......They aren't very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Mm, I leave it to you. My friend, {f:5:Virgilia}. ......The rest of you, follow me."""
,Kinzo turned with a grand swish of his cloak.
,"Following him were Ronove and Gaap, ......as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants."
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......You three are supposed to wait here with me. Don't follow them."""
,The goats jumped in surprise and then came plodding back.
,"Kyrie, who had been watching in disbelief as all of this played out, couldn't help but snort."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Heheh...... What entertaining underlings."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} did not give you permission to speak freely."""
,...She was probably a little embarrassed.
,"{f:5:Virgilia} had spoken coldly, but Kyrie could see right through that, and for a little while, she couldn't restrain her muffled laughter."
,"However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him."
,"Because, including Kinzo himself, at least ten enemies had already been spotted..."
,......The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian.
,"Although this mansion's existence had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known it for a fact until today."
,"Were there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima, unknown to all but Kinzo, hiding untold numbers of henchmen that only Kinzo knew of...?"
,"Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...?"
,"No, actually...Are we the only ones under the impression that there are only 18 people on this island......?"
,"As we bickered over whether {f:5:Beatrice} existed or not, and racked our brains over something as minor as a 19th person, were we on this island the perfect example of frogs in a well...?"
,"No, wait, in fact... At this point, are there actually more people on the enemy's side than on ours...?"
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............Just what the hell is going on...... Witches? Demons? Magic? ......Am I supposed to believe in those? Are my eyes screwed up? Or is my head? ...I think I'm losing it........."""
,A mass murder by magic.{n}Demons forming and disappearing in thin air.
,"More importantly than the enemy's numbers, how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of this world?"
,"......Kyrie started to feel like she didn't know what was going on anymore, and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she clenched her teeth in an attempt to hold onto her sanity..."
,"Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed."
,"......But they had been threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages' safety could not be guaranteed..."
,"It was fairly hard to get them to agree, but once the idea was raised that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them through a cracked‐open window after they were shut inside, ......and it was suggested that blankets and food could be carried in for them, they were finally convinced."
Kumasawa Chiyo,""".........This place is pretty chilly... I wonder how long we'll have to stay locked in here......"""
Ushiromiya George,"""......In the worst case, it'll be until Monday morning, so a full day and night. ......I really feel bad about doing this to you two..."""
,"George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there.{n}They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It'll be hard for you guys to go until Monday morning with just this... If only we could have stopped by the kitchen..."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""We were told not to go to any unnecessary places. ......They do apparently have us under surveillance, after all. .........Dammit."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use...... And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides........."""
Ushiromiya George,"""It can't be helped. ......More importantly, we're trusting you to take care of Kumasawa‐san. ...We don't know what's going to happen. When it comes down to it, I want you to do what you can to help her. And more than anything, I want you to be safe..."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""...Yes, I understand. ......Please, be careful, everyone. Right now, the Master is......taking human lives like they're pieces on a chessboard. ...Please be careful."""
,"Gohda stared at the floor, remembering that atrocity in the dining hall, even now unable to believe what had happened, and he hung his head in shame at his inability to fully describe that terror."
Ushiromiya George,"""Thank you. .........Please make sure you stay on your guard. You too, Kumasawa‐san."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""......And you all please take care as well...... I don't have any idea what's going on anymore......"""
Ushiromiya George,"""Well then, ......we'll be off. Let's go, Battler‐kun. Jessica‐chan. ......Come on, Maria‐chan, you too."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""............Uu."""
,"Looking at the painful expression on the faces of the pair to be imprisoned, it became hard to close the shutter."
,But we can't disobey.{n}......We're being watched.
,We brought the shutter down and locked it.{n}Then George headed to the small window on the side of the storehouse.
,It was a small latticed window which could only be used for light and ventilation.
,"It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable, ......but on the other hand, it would protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates, or so one would hope..."
,He opened the window and called out.
Ushiromiya George,"""......Are you alright? You're not cold, are you?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""We're alright. We've been given all these blankets, after all. ......If we wrap ourselves up, we'll be just fine."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I wish we could have brought them a kerosene stove or something......"""
Ushiromiya George,"""......But it wouldn't have ventilation here. It's tough, but there's nothing we can do now. ......Hostages are being held against us. We can't disobey..."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Dammit... ......If we could just save Kyrie‐san and the rest somehow......"""
Ushiromiya George,"""Shh. ......They might be able to hear you. .........Gohda‐san, here. The key to the shutter."""
,George threw the key in through the tiny window.
Gohda Toshiro,"""......Thank you. I'll hold on to it."""
,"Gohda took the key, and after showing it to Kumasawa, placed it in his own pocket."
,There was only one key to the gardening shed's shutter.{n}That was being held by those who were locked up inside it.
,"If the children had held onto it, then if it was stolen from them by some chance, that would risk exposing the lives of those in the shed to danger."
,"And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside. It satisfied Kinzo's demand."
,"However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either. This would protect them."
,"Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ......and we could do nothing but trust that this cold locked room would protect them."
,"Holding Maria's hand, Jessica watched George hand over the key, then looked over the thickets in the pitch‐black rose garden."
,"......Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether they obeyed orders or not."
,"Of course, merely pointing their flashlights out there did nothing to make any suspicious silhouettes appear."
,But somebody was surely out there...hiding and watching.
,They were hit many times with an urge to scream at them.{n}......But they held that back through reason.
,"The four children left the area behind, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders."
,The feeble light from the lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly.
,"......Was it at all possible that this insane incident would somehow come to an end, ......so that they could see those two again?"
,"......To George, who had closed the shutter himself, ...the resistance of the lock made it feel as though he had killed them with his own hands."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........But even so......we can't disobey......"""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""A {i:test}...? ......What the hell, old man......! Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that...... I don't get it, I'll kill him...!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......It's alright, Jessica onee‐chan. There's nothing to be sad about......"""
Ushiromiya Jessica,""".........Maria......"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""The witch will be revived very soon. .........It won't be long before you can see her in the Golden Land. ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi............ Ouch."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't laugh at inappropriate times. ......Seriously, a resurrection ritual for a witch? He should just keep his fantasies to the inside of his head. Getting all these people involved... ........That's gonna cost you, ...bastard..."""
Ushiromiya George,""".........Let's return to the guesthouse. ...It'll be bad if we aren't there when Grandfather calls."""
,"Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse......"
,"At that moment, Jessica spun around, and roared towards the darkness of the rose garden."
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""..................HEY!! Someone's watching, right?! Tell the old man...!! Tell him I'm gonna friggin' kill him!! Let's go...!!"""
,"Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain......"
,The children returned to the guesthouse...{n}...In fear of what would be waiting for them when they got back.
,"After they departed, .........from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at, two rabbit ears sprung up..."
Chiester45,"""......S‐sorsorsorryyyy...! They found me ouuuut...!!"""
Chiester410,"""It's 'cause you're too slow, 45, nye~h. Ni~hihihi~, Pendragon‐sama's going to scold youu~{p:0:♪}"""
Chiester45,"""I'm sorry I'm sorry, please don't tell Pendragon‐sama on meeeee!"""
Chiester00,"""Shut up be quiet. It was obviously just a bluff. ...Gohda and Kumasawa's imprisonment confirmed. Mission accomplished. Time to report back."""
Chiester410,"""Neener‐neener. Nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi! Ouch."""
Chiester00,"""Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility? ......Let's go."""
,It certainly seemed to be a fact that they were being watched.
,"Because once they returned to the cousins' room, turned the lights on, and lay down on their beds, the phone rang again."
,"Up until now, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as it was her house, but now it was George, as the eldest, who picked it up."
,"This time, Kyrie‐san was on the other end of the phone.{n}George handed it to Battler out of consideration..."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Hello. Kyrie‐san? Is everything alright over there...?!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Thanks for worrying. ...It's agreeable for now. .....................Sorry, I've been ordered to refrain from speaking freely. Listen closely to what I'm about to tell you."""
,The fact that they were hostages still hadn't changed.{n}And Kinzo or one of his subordinates was probably listening to this conversation.
,"Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things, and focused on what Kyrie had to say."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""The tests will be given to Jessica‐chan, George‐kun, Battler‐kun, and Maria‐chan, in that order. .........You'll be called out in turn, so until then, do not leave the room. The person who is called out will head to their designated location, alone."""
,Battler repeated it out loud so that his cousins would also understand.
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria in that order, stay in the room until we're called, right. ......Got it... ......Maria too? Even a nine year old girl... What's that old fart going to force her to do, goddammit..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...............The future of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands. ......Do your best."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Hm. ...............Sure."""
,"Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie's words.{n}Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long‐lasting bond they shared."
,Now was not the time to worry about the future of the Ushiromiya family.{n}......That wasn't the message that Kyrie wanted to send.
,"She probably meant ""there is no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued. Our lives are in your hands""."
,......Something like that.
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, leave it to us. No idea what kind of test it is, but bring it on. I'm not backing down from that challenge. .........It's a serious test, right? ...It's OK for us to......go all out?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Yes. It's a serious test. He plans to {i:seriously} test you all."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's no good, no goddamn good at all. ......Some old fart on death's door thinks he can take me when I'm serious?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Let's see him spew that shit from beyond the grave. He's there, so tell him this for me: The next head is me. And my first action will be to implant my fist into your face...!"""
,"Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler's powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo's ears..."
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Fuhahahahahahahaha!! Battleeeeer, I will truly be looking forward to it!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""I can't wait to see just what a man who once discarded the Ushiromiya name has attained, to just what state of mind he has ascended as he stands before me!! Tell him that...!"""
,"Unfortunately, Kinzo's voice was not picked up by the receiver. So Kyrie spoke for him."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""He says he's more than up for the challenge. .....Alright, Battler‐kun. There's no need to hold back. .........You are Rudolf‐san's son."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......No, you are my son. Show me something I won't be embarrassed to brag about. .........I entrust everything to you......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Roger that, Mom. .........Leave the rest to us...!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,""".........All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of head. ......Now we're just the same as pieces taken off the chessboard, looking on from the outside. So you'll have to fight by yourselves."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............Kyrie‐san........."""
,The nuance of those words was.........
,"""We've already given up. ...You can forget about us."""
,"......But.........for that very reason, I won't give up......{n}I'm going to wreck this test or whatever, and save everyone...!"
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Well then, ......here are the instructions for the first test, Jessica‐chan's. ......Head to your own room, he says."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Own room?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It seems he means Jessica's personal room in the mansion."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........I'll hand it over to Jessica. Tell her directly. ......Jessica."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""He‐hello...... ............Okay, ...I understand..."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""............Me first, huh... ......I'm ready. Be right back!"""
,"In actuality, Jessica was probably feeling the fear of a girl her age."
,......But she buried those feelings and strengthened her resolve.
Ushiromiya George,"""Be careful, ......okay?"""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......We're being watched, right? We can't do anything. All we can do is exactly as we're told."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall in an instant, with no hesitation. ......It might be the same for us."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""I get it. ............I'll pay him back."""
Ushiromiya George,"""Don't do anything reckless. .........If you think you're in any danger, you put yourself first. ......If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him, there's no doubt it would tear his heart apart."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It goes the other way too. .........If Mom and Dad were both killed, and I was the only one left, my heart would rip itself to pieces."""
Ushiromiya George,""".............................. ......Battler‐kun. Is what you said earlier true......?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah. ......Kyrie‐san and the others are already......prepared for what will happen."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Then I'm even more sure I'm ready. ......Their lives rest on our shoulders. The hostages can't do anything while locked up. So it's up to us to do something about it."""
Ushiromiya George,""".........If anything happens, run back to the guesthouse. At that time, we'll be done playing along with Grandfather's game."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aniki........."""
Ushiromiya George,"""At that time, we will declare war. .........Wherever they're locked up, we'll save them, and we'll see that Grandfather gets what he deserves."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Are you sure, Aniki? ......Shannon‐chan's there too."""
Ushiromiya George,"""........................ ......That doesn't mean I'll sit around and wait for my fiancée to be killed. .........What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather."""
Ushiromiya George,"""{i:I'm just worried you guys will be first to find that doddering old bastard who gave my fiancée a taste of terror, and literally beat me to the punch}."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Now I get it... ......Yeah, this really is a test to settle who the next head's gonna be."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yep. ......The first one to bury a fist into that old geezer's face is the successor."""
,"George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together."
,"Then Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated......"
,"Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden, which was shaking in the violent winds."
,"......As they saw her off, George and Battler hardened their trembling fists....."
,"Jessica's back was watched through the window by Maria, who had remained upstairs."
,Her expression was blank......
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......I wonder why everyone is getting so upset. .........When {f:5:Beatrice} is revived, we can get her to bring everyone back to life."""
,Jessica's form had already been completely swallowed up by the darkness.
,"......At that time, the phone began to ring again."
,"Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away."
Ushiromiya Maria,"""...............Hello."""
Shannon,"""M‐......Maria‐sama...? It's Shannon. ......Would you please hand the phone to George‐sama?"""
,"This time, it was Shannon on the phone."
,"And the purpose of the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go......"
