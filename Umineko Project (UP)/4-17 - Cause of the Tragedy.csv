Ushiromiya Maria,"""......I don't know why you're angry, Battler."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You {i:should?!} Everyone was killed, goddammit!! By that goddamned old fart! Saying something incomprehensible about {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual or something!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Then, that means, thirteen people have been offered as sacrifices, ......and {f:5:Beatrice} will have revived already, you know?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, that's perfect!! I'll take {f:5:Beatrice} too and kill them both!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""............We survived the ritual. So we'll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from {f:5:Beatrice}, you see......?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""All wishes are granted there. If you're suffering because your family was killed, then you just have to bring them back to life. ......That's what I plan to do. I'm going to revive my really nice real mama, the one that isn't possessed by the black witch."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......So Mama will always be with me from now on. .........There won't be any more overtime or working on days off. ...She'll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she'll fight all the time against fearsome enemies for me. Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......There's something wrong with you. ......How can you sit there saying such incomprehensible crap in a situation like this...?!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""............Didn't Auntie Kyrie just tell you, Battler...? ......Didn't she tell you...to believe......in the witch?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".....................Sh‐shit. This isn't the time to get in an argument with you...!! Forget ""hostages"", at this point, there's no one left alive at all! This dumb‐as‐hell, screwed‐up ritual game is done now...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""From here on, I'm doing what {i:I} want. Someone might still be alive. Or someone might be hiding! I'll search every nook and cranny of this place, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"""
,"In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat‐stand spear and flew out of the room."
,"Maria watched him go, looking bored..."
Ushiromiya Maria,""".........But {f:5:Beatrice} would grant your wishes soon anyway. ......Stupid Battler. ......Kihhihihihi."""
,"Then, the phone rang out again......"
,"Maria stood up, and grabbed the receiver."
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu. Hello. ......Uu? Uu!!!"""
,"Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler's ears as he was about to dash out of the guesthouse."
,"With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins' room..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""M‐Maria......! The phone call, ......who's it from...?!"""
,"With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone."
,"You couldn't blame him...... Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa."
,But there was no way those two could call when they were locked up in the gardening storehouse.
,......Which meant.........there was only one person.{n}It had to be Kinzo.
,"As she happily chatted with the person on the other end of the phone, Maria slowly turned to face Battler."
,".........And, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed with a ""kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi"".{n}......It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Maria...who's on the phone? ......Grandfather......?!"""
,Battler couldn't imagine that this was the case.
,"...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would be having such a friendly talk with Kinzo, ......chatting to him about Battler with that eerie smile on her face."
,Just what kind of person could be on the phone.........who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?
,".........At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up."
,"Even if a witch does appear, there is no need to doubt it.{n}......Just.........believe in its existence......"
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Yep. Battler just came back. He sure is hasty. Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Maria!! Who's on the phone?! Who?!?!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......Hand it over? Sure. ............Here, Battler."""
,"After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..................uh."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Here."""
,"Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ......as though it was perfectly normal."
,Battler felt just a little bit of hesitation towards taking the receiver.
,"......Because, .........by acknowledging the existence of the person at the other end, .........he would have no choice but to admit it."
,.........Kyrie had said it.
,......There is no longer......any need......to doubt their existence...
,Battler took the receiver.
,"After he did so, Maria briskly headed for the door."
,"Battler, who was slightly fearful about finding out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver, questioned Maria before taking the call."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""H‐hey! Where are you going...?!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""To where my test is. ......I wonder who the Ushiromiya family head will be, you or me. Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........D‐don't go!! You'll be killed!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""No I won't. The ritual's already over. ...And even if I am, I'll be revived. ......Whether one of us becomes the head or not, we're already invited to the Golden Land. See you."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wait!! Maria...!!!"""
,"Battler stretched his hand out to Maria's back as she left, ......but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping held him back like a chain."
,......He readied himself. ...Battler put the receiver to his ear......
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............He‐......hello......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""<Congratulaatioooooooons>!! <And I'm fi~ne>!! <And yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oouuuuu>?! Aaa{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}h{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaaaaa!!!"""
,"Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.{n}......It was the voice of a woman he didn't know."
,......Who—the inside of his head was starting to freeze up—............who............
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What do you mean ""who"", Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...? The answer, normally, is <ye~s, I'm fine>! Is it not?? That takes me back...you must have done that one in middle school, right? That thing you do in pairs! Uhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyaaaaahh!!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Y‐...you're insane...... Who are you?!! Answer me!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Say it in Engliiish. Isn't that your specialtyyyyy?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Qui‐quit messing with me...... Who are you?!! That crazy old bastard's underling?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""‘Underling’ is a cruel description. Go the other way and try ""captive"". ......I have Kinzo captive! Ri~~ght? Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha..."""
,That last laugh didn't sound like it was aimed at Battler.
,"......It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......S‐......say your goddamned name!! Who are you?! Who?!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Try and guess, you could win a invite to Hawaii! Ahhyah{0}hyah{0}hhyaaaah!! Fffinally. FINALLY!! Mmmmmmm, it was soooo looo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ong, the days leading up to today were reee{-}e{-}eeally long...!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I seriously waited a thousand years, you know?? For this day to arrive!! And here it is, all thanks to you, my BIG resurrection!! <Thank you>, Kinzo! Just this once, I'll let you have that last takeback of yo~urs!!!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Hell's bells, do you have to be in this much of a good mood? Can't you act a little more ladylike?"""
,Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.
,Also on the table were expensive cheeses and the like to go with drinks.{n}And there was a line of several empty wine bottles.
,"As {f:5:Beatrice} rolled around in her sofa in an unseemly way, she held a wine glass in one hand, in a good mood, ......and probably, completely drunk."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'm in the {i:best} mood today, so I'm feeling crazy generous!! Hey, hey, Kinzo, don't use a well‐aged noble rot wine like this as a decoration! Hooooly shit, it's a 1947?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If you don't open it today, just when are you gonna open it?! Let's slosh it all over each other for fun! Then let's whack each other with the empty bottle! Uhhyah{0}hyah{0}hyahhya!!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hahhaha, that would be entertaining. You are a little too excited. You're cutting loose too much."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And what about youuuuuu?! Aren't you happy to be reunited with meee? Aaah, it's the living world! The earthly world!! Long live my flesh!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......What......are you going on about.........? ...Are you saying that you're......B‐{f:5:Beatrice} or something...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""<Ye~eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!! Thanks to Kinzo's thirteen‐person murder ritual, I've finally been resurrected...!! It's nice having a mouth, it's nice having a tongue! How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Come to think of it, even though we've hurled insults at each other over and over again, this is the first time we've had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn't it? How very fresh!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh, did you hear that pop sound?! He {i:opened} it, the maniac actually went and opened that vintage wine that's expensive as shit!! Do you know how much a single bottle of that stuff {i:costs}?! As much as a whole ten‐kilogram ingot, isn't that craaaaaazy?!?! Hiiiii‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""C‐cut the crap...!! {f:5:Beatrice} my ass...!! You say you're the Golden Witch?! That's enough!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Where the hell are you?! Is that damn old fart with you as well?! I'll beat the shit out of both of you!! Where are you right now?! Answer me!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ohhh, so you want to meeeet me? Uhhihihihi, sure is tough being a popular woman! But please, don't try to chat me up when Kinzo's around, okaay? The guy's a bad egg, he gets seriously jealous, see?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........But when Kinzo isn't around and we're all alone, I'll love you all you want in secret, alright...? Uhyaaahya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkyakkya!!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Y‐you're insane........."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kinzoo, I've changed my mind. I won't do Maria's test. You go."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""How fickle. Then you are saying that you will do Battler's test?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Nothing wrong with that, ri~ght?! That guy's so much like a younger you, y'know? It makes my heart race."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Don't worry, I'm not gonna cheat on yooooou. I'll only be alone with him this one time. ......I'm always alone with you, riiight...? But no more tying me up twenty‐four hours a day, alright? Kuhhyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So there you have it, Battlerr! I, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, will be running your test myself! As for the place...let me see. At the front entrance to this mansion!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Battlerr, this headship test, you've seriously gotta full‐ass this one, okaay? ......I mean, Kinzo's practically dead on his feet. If you become the next head, you'll be the new owner of everything on this island."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......I wouldn't mind letting you have me all to yourself, you know......? Just like Kinzo did, ......control me, okay......? Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, uhhya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Th‐the front entrance of the mansion...... Perfect...!! Listen to me, you stinking drunk!! I'll sober you up. And I've got some {i:hot punch} waiting to help you through your hangover!! Just you wait!!"""
,Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.{n}There was no need to talk through a receiver anymore.
,......I'll meet her face to face and settle this!!
,"I took the spear I'd made by taking apart the hat stand, and went outside without even an umbrella."
,......It's hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} will be waiting for me alone.
,...I should probably assume that she'll be waiting with those supporting troops that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san told us about.
,Going alone would be too reckless...
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san...! It's me, it's Battler...!"""
,I headed for the gardening storehouse first.{n}I need all the help I can get.
,"Gohda‐san's a burly man, so I can probably count on him to add some extra brawn.{n}Kumasawa‐san's knowledge and familiarity with the area as a senior servant might prove to be a huge weapon."
,"Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do. ......They're pretty reliable allies."
,"As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside."
,I would have to get the key back from them and open the shutter myself.
,"I went around to the side, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it up."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Gohda‐san, Kumasawa baa‐chan...! It's Battler...!! Hey, come on, get up...............h...ey........."""
,"The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, .........was all too......bizarre......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Gohda...sa...n...... ......Kumasawa......sa.........n........."""
,"From a low ceiling beam.........hung two thick ropes, ......and at the ends, ......Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san............were hanging...by their necks....."
,"It was dim, and I was looking through a narrow gap between all the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn't make out any more detail than that."
,"......But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them, and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You've got to be............kidding me......right............? ......Why........."""
,The shutter is still closed.
,"......And there's only a single key, which I'm sure Gohda‐san took possession of."
,So how did the culprit......open the shutter and kill the two of them inside......?
,"No wait, they weren't necessarily killed...{n}If this is a suicide......"
,"......That way, this locked room makes sense, but I don't know why the two of them would hang themselves...!!"
,"Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot."
,"Now, the only humans alive on this island......are me, Maria, ......and my old bastard's old bastard."
,".........No, there's also that nutso woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}..."
,Maria's been acting like she's on the witch's side from the beginning.{n}And Gramps is the very person who revived the witch.{n}Plus there's the witch herself.
,"......What the hell... .........Then, it's just as though............I'm the only one on this island............"
,"Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose to my feet."
,"......Damn, I can't do it like this...{n}I've got to avenge...everyone......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Damn iiiiiiiit...... This is no good... Yeah, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all... Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt........."""
,I got the crying out of the way while I could... So that all my weak emotions would be squeezed out with my tears...
,"Then, ......I straightened up, and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion."
,".........At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting."
,"I'll go, ......and settle this."
,"I'll find the source of this weird, blood‐soaked night, ......and crush her with my own hands...!"
,"Amidst the pouring rain, ......I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked."
,......I could see the arbor in the distance.
,"According to Jessica, it seemed that George‐aniki had also been killed..."
,"Well, by this point, there's no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.{n}......I left the path, aiming for the arbor."
,"Then, ............I saw George‐aniki's weather‐beaten corpse..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............Aniki...... ............Shit............"""
,The corpse was in front of the arbor.
,"If he could have died under the arbor, he would at least have been spared being beaten down upon by the rain..."
,"There was a gaping hole in Aniki's forehead, as though he had been shot with a gun."
,"Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn't covered with blood, ......and so he looked almost like he was sleeping."
,"...However, the deep red his clothes were stained still provided the evidence that a large amount of blood had flowed out..."
,"How happy I'd be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead..."
,"......But Aniki's eyes remained open, even though the rain sprayed against them."
,"......And......the hole in his forehead was, without a hint of a joke, ......the real thing..."
,There had been a faint chance...that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed could have been a bad joke.
,But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.
,"And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure."
,Just as Gohda‐san had once said. ......The enemy came to take lives as though these lives were pieces on a chess board.
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Yeah, ......there's no mistake. ......It seems that old geezer and the witch.........really don't view our lives as anything more than that......"""
,"...That damn witch, when she was on the phone...{n}She talked about us like we were ""on the game board""......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Perfect...... ......Right, she thinks this is a game, huh...... Then, ...in the same way you killed everyone like it was a game, .........it's alright if I kill all of you like it's a game as well, right......?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Just you wait...... ......{f:5:Beatrice}........."""
,The lightning caused the mansion's vast shadow to emerge.
,"......Finally, ......the mansion."
,"As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.{n}It seemed that there weren't any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that."
,".........According to Kyrie‐san, there were a large number of attendants with goat heads."
,"At least for now, I couldn't sense...any large group like that hiding and staring at me..."
,"What's this......?{n}Beneath the roof of the entrance, .........there's something set down."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......What is this? .........A...box?"""
,It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.
,......Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you'd find in a reception room.
,"Either way, it didn't look like something that belonged here...{n}It clearly looked......as though I was being told to open it."
,"But the thought of doing what they wanted me to do was somehow irritating.{n}......However, it didn't look like we'd get anywhere if I didn't open it."
,Could it be that it's set up with some trap to make it explode when opened......?
,"While thinking things like that, and forgetting even to go under the overhang, I continued to glare at the box as the rain beat down upon me."
,"Then, .........mixed in with the thunder, was some kind of......music? ...It sounded like something like that."
,......It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing midnight.
,"It was also the sound that announced that the crazy day of October 4th had finally ended, ......and that the much more incredibly crazy day of October 5th had begun."
,"That sound quietened, ............and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere......"
,"I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ......and I looked up at the sky."
,"......And there.........was a woman I had never seen before.{n}No, it's not true that I've never seen her before.{n}......I saw her once today."
,"Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion......"
,"The clothes were different, ......but that face was just like the witch of the portrait......"
,"Aaah, who am I kidding... I already know who this person is...!!"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......S‐......so you are {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yooohooooooooo, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"""
,"Leaning over the second floor balcony, ......and waving cheerily from under her umbrella, ......was, without a doubt, ......the witch of the portrait, ...{f:5:Beatrice}.........!!"
,Was the plan for the boss to watch on from above as her goat underlings torture me to death...?!
,"I adjusted my grip on the spear, and, imagining goats creeping out of the surrounding shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ahhaha, be at ease, there's no one here but you and me, see? There is no goat furniture, there are no demon butlers; Master is not here, nor my close demon friend."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And there are none of the gold butterflies that help compose my physical form, there are no magic circles, and no summoners in attendance!! ......Do you know what this means?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Not a clue. Quit babbling..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I have in fact met you several times even in this world. Almost as though brushing past one another, meeting only for a moment. ......As you know, this world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the defense around you, the king! And through multiple games, I advanced my pieces one by one, splitting you apart, and cornering you, undermining your ramparts bit by bit."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Then, finally, once I opened a tiny crack, I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you. .........But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""As long as you stay on the black squares, a black bishop can exert massive influence upon you, but if you escape just one step to a white square, then even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is why I have progressed through these games by sending in various pieces so that you cannot stay on a white square, forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Howeeever!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""There are now holes opened all over your ramparts, and I was at last able to send in, not a bishop, but a full queen!! Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""A rook plus a bishop. ......Is this what you're trying to say? ...Now, you not only control the black squares that are the witch illusions, but have also become able to encroach upon the white squares of the human world at will...?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is correct!! Where there exist the gold butterflies that are my minions, you have been labeling those squares as witch illusions, denying them under the hypothesis that they are observerless nonreality, am I right...? *cackle*cackle*, I am well aware......!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""For that very reason, I have at last descended thus upon the squares of white!! Worry not, I'll call plenty of gold butterflies, goats, demons, and witches later on! If you wish, I will invite you to my Golden Land!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""There, I will grant you any wish that you desire...!! Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......It's starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I see, that too is a pleasant description...! *cackle*cackle*, soon, you will be covered in that ink as well. Before long, you will become dyed pitch‐black, and surely become a black king...! At this point, you are a pitiful existence drowning in a sea of ink, are you not?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""No, I'm not. I'll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle, ......but there's still a white square left."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh, and where...?!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Right under my feet. .........Your magic ink may try to cover the entire island, but it can't cover the ground my feet are standing on. ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch‐black at a glance, I am me. I am here, with my feet firmly planted on a white square!!"""
,"It's strange... Until a second ago, I was trembling all over."
,"......But now that she's appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened."
,It's funny. Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.
,"When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there's nothing scary about it...!!"
,"......However, she is definitely not a funny or a friendly person."
,"......She can kill me instantly while rolling around giggling, just by snapping a finger."
,"Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn't matter."
,"......In any case, whether this is fantasy or mystery, that queen is in a position where she can kill me just by snapping her fingers......!"
,"...I see, ......so this is the meaning.........of the queen of this island, ...who reigns over both the white and black squares......?!"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Now then. It might be interesting to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it's about time to move to the matter at hand. .........I am sure that you can tell there is a box there? Your test is inside of it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Hold it. ......After all that's happened, I'm not interested in some stupid game about who'll be the next head."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""My game is to take you and the old man, ......and all the rest of you guys who killed everyone, and give every one of you a full‐on punch to the face."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh. So you will fly through the sky up to my balcony? Very good, very good, *cackle*! Come on then, up you come already, come on come on, up up!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Damn you, acting like you're hot shit just 'cause you're in a completely safe place... I'm coming up there right now, so you better be prepared!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Aah, no, no, no. It's all locked up. Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows as well. My castle isn't so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"""
,"I tried the front door anyway just in case, ......but, yup, it really was locked.{n}When I looked around, I noticed that indeed the shutters were closed on the windows."
,"......Normally, they wouldn't be."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Tch. Looks like you prepare for everything. ......Where's the key?!"""
,"Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san probably have master keys, but they're in the locked room of the gardening storehouse."
,......I can only give up for now...!
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Damn...... ......Guess she's no fool herself."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Are you really so dying to be right by my siiiide? Alright, if you pass your test with flying colors, why don't I grant you an audience? If you pass, then you will be the successor, and my new master after Kinzo."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......My body and soul will be yours to do with as you will. Because I am ultimately the Ushiromiya family's furniture! Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Well, it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what. ......Alright. I'm game. ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Scary, scaary... But it's not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see? {i:Grab}...onto my head! Make my face twist in pain, violate me in the same way a hawk tears apart and scratches at its prey with its talons...!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!! That single time in my thousand‐year life! Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, of submitting and being reduced to furnituuuuuuuure!! Uhyaaa{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You damn drunk, we aren't getting anywhere."""
,"Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. Open it. Inside is a letter. Read it."""

,"I opened it. ......There was a faint smell of cigarettes.{n}Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.{n}But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside."
,"Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest.{n}And when I opened that too, ......there was a letter inside."
,I looked up at the witch. She was grinning down at me.
,......It seemed she was waiting in anticipation to see what kind of reaction I'd have to the contents.
,"......Dammit, I'll show her. Its contents were like this..."

{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mm. That second one is where you put the name of the one that person loves the most. For Jessica's test, it was Kanon's name, and for George's test it was Shannon's name."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, I was able to write those names in beforehand, but I don't know who you have feelings for. So I didn't know whose name to write, and left it blank."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's perfect. I love you, {f:5:Beatrice}. I'll stick your name in here. So my choice is going to be number two. Is that alright?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hey, hey, quit joking, quit joking. Come onnn, please, Battler. Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for. If you don't, then this won't be a test, right?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Too bad. I don't have any woman in particular. Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In that case, this test will not work for you. Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame. And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea! *cackle*cackle*!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........What if I said I like young, flat‐chested girls with long, black hair. You don't match in a single area, do you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Lies, you breast sommelier! You prefer a blonde bombshell with a <dynamite body>, don't you?! I am precisely the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the successor, I'll take it gladly."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ah, yes. This was the test to choose the successor. Chatting with you is so much fun that I've been getting a bit off topic."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Then let us begin the headship test. I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the next Ushiromiya family head. Answer with care."""
,"The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her gravitas."
,......She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that imposing portrait...
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of my gold—that is what I will test. .........State your name."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Ushiromiya...Battler."""
,"Under that majestic gaze, unimaginable from her manner a short while ago, I answered without any hesitation."
,"......She truly was......yes, indeed, ......in the truest sense, she was that worthy of calling herself the queen of this island."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Very good, Ushiromiya Battler. .........However, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name for the past six years, have you not...? Why is that...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........mgh............ ......Because I'd had enough of my dad, the old bastard."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I know. It was because you felt your father's remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you loved and respected, yes...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever. It is not as though I cannot understand why you would feel unable to accept that mother. ......However, no matter who your father remarries with, that does not change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........What's your point?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I can, to an extent, understand the childishness which led you to oppose your father's remarriage out of a desire to have him all to yourself."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not? Do you think you were qualified to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......It has nothing to do with you. This is between me and Dad...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone. You are a child who simply rebelled, unable to forgive the fact that your father was to be stolen away by an unknown woman. ......Those six years during which you forsook the Ushiromiya register were a significantly long period where you dragged the Ushiromiya name through the mud. Know the depths of your sinfulness."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..................Well, sorry I'm so childish..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However. Even though it was prompted by the deaths of your grandparents, I do commend you for returning to the Ushiromiya register. Accordingly, I shall give you a chance to purify yourself of that sin. Now is the time to atone for your sin of six years ago."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Come, try to remember, remember your own sin. Remember it, confess, and repent. ............That shall be my test for you."""
,"......At that moment, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".............................. ......Repent? ...What? .........Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........The test has already begun. You may think as you wish."""
,"There were no signs from the witch's expression that she was sneering at a person unable to answer the tough question thrust upon them.{n}......She was earnestly asking something of him, and he could even feel a quiet determination."
,"Even as the rain beat upon him, Battler could not shift his eyes from her gaze."
,......The witch threw her umbrella away.{n}She abandoned herself to the falling rain.
,So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.
,"......She had chosen to join him, allowing the rain to beat down on her as well, until he reached an answer."
,"For some reason, Battler could tell that.{n}......But, even so, ......he didn't understand."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""W‐......well, ...uh. ......I mean, you're right, I do think I was being childish... All things considered, just 'cause Dad got remarried, that doesn't wipe out what I owe him for raising me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I hear Dad always kept on sending money over for my living expenses, ......and he even said he wanted to be involved in my school events. .........The only reason he couldn't come is......I told Grandma and Grandpa not to let him come no matter what......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......................................."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......A‐and yeah, ......if you want to just be blunt and say I was being childish and rebellious, I can't argue with that. .........But you know, ...in that case, ......Mom, ......Ushiromiya Asumu, who's gonna set things right for her...?! Mom was so devoted to our family, and did the very best she could...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But Dad was cheating with Kyrie‐san. He even got her pregnant with Ange...! And then the moment she was born, he rushed them both into his register."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......What is that if not a betrayal of Mom?! Who's gonna set things...right...for her?!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......But what you're saying is also right. Even though the cheating was a fact, I still owed him for raising me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So I thought I'd cancel those two things out and leave the family, what's the problem with that?!! That's right, I had the right, ......no, the duty to wallop Dad in Mom's place, didn't I?!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I let him get away without that! I left without saying anything, as though I hadn't been there in the first place!! And Dad forgot about me and started a new family with Kyrie‐san and Ange! That settles everything, doesn't it?!!"""
,But six years passed after that. ......Time healed the anger.
,"Kyrie‐san understood my anger as well, and she tried hard to interact with me despite that, and soften my heart."
,"Ange didn't know anything about the situation, and she adored me, believing that I was her real big brother who just lived in a separate house."
,"......As for Dad, he was acting like nothing had happened, and told me I could come home any time I wanted."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It started to feel more and more stupid keeping it all going!! I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well. So I said to Dad that if he apologized, I'd call it water under the bridge. On the day of Grandpa's funeral."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""And that guy, he actually put both his hands on the floor and apologized...!! I couldn't believe how pathetic he looked...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""My dad, who was all about looking cool, actually bowed his goddamn head to me...! ......When I saw that, it felt like it'd be stupid to keep it up any longer."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'm sure Mom would've thought the same thing! Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us. ""Oh, that silly thing is what you were fighting over?"" she'd say. ......I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's why, ......while I couldn't bring myself to say ""I forgive you"", .........I thought it might be alright to start over again from zero. So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago. .........And I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!! I'd cried, raged, and stressed over it for a whole six years!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It might have been the same for Dad, and maybe even for my dead mom. Maybe Kyrie‐san and Ange too. ......So we went back to zero, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!! That's my immediate family's problem, ......and has nothing the hell to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You aren't qualified to judge that to be a sin, and I have no duty to show repentance to you! If there was anyone I should have done that for, you've already killed them!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So I won't apologize for anything! I won't repent!!! That is my answer for this test!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".......................................... ......Is that all...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What.........? .................."""
,"I had pretty much fully responded to her provocation, and I was sure that I'd vented out all the stuff that I'd been keeping inside my chest, stuff I hadn't wanted to show anyone."
,"That was what the witch had supposedly been hoping for, too. ......And yet, the witch's blank expression didn't change in the slightest."
,"I had been sure she would start cackling and guffawing, sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past."
,"But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of shock about her, ......something you could almost call disappointment."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........What do you mean ""is that all"", ......I've confessed everything inside me! What aren't you happy about?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The atonement for your sins is still insufficient."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Atonement? ......What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............No. I have no interest in the home affairs of your immediate family. Where are we? Rokkenjima. The main residence of the Ushiromiya head family. ......Isn't there a sin you should remember, fitting for this place......?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Are you......saying that I have...another sin......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Remember, Ushiromiya Battler. .........And it is your inability to remember which is your sin. For that reason, I shall forgive you. If you can remember, I shall forgive you. .........Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........That's......a lot easier said than done......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............Remember. ......That is why it is a sin."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Sorry, Beato. ......I have absolutely no memory of it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You make it seem like I caused you trouble six years ago or something, but unless I'm mistaken, this family conference is the first time we met. It's true that your legend did exist six years ago, but I'm pretty confident that we didn't know each other back then."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Naturally. On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I was not yet manifested."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then what kind of sin are you saying I have? ......Are you saying......I've sinned against you somehow...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Do not make me repeat myself. I was not manifested six years ago. For us to have been acquainted would be an impossibility. In the world you represent, it was as though I did not even exist."""
,......Beato's cold eyes......felt as though they were accusing me of some kind of sin.
,"It felt, on the face of it, as though she was still holding a grudge for some way I'd treated her, and was criticizing me for it."
,"However, ......I obviously couldn't remember doing anything like that to her, and Beato had said so herself."
,There was no link between us six years ago.
,"{p:1:Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for me}."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........At least give me a hint. ......Does this sin or whatever...have something to do with......you and me......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I had no connection to you six years ago. Remove me from your thoughts already. ......Why...do you think it is a sin against {i:me}?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Your......eyes."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Eyes...? ............Hoh."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Your eyes, they're......whispering at me to apologize. ......But I had no connection with you six years ago, and even you admitted that."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Is it true? ......Is it really not a problem between me and you......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........I already said it wasn't. No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But still, ......your eyes are telling me differently. ............So I don't even have a clue. .........Can you say it in red? Can you declare that the sin you're telling me to remember isn't something between you and me?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................... ......Very well."""
,{p:1:The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and {f:5:Beatrice}}.
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Then why are you looking at me with those eyes......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I do not know. .........I am simply gazing at you blankly. If it feels that way to you, ......perhaps that is because there is something that makes you feel that way."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................ .........What the hell kind of sin have I got?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler has a sin}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I said what kind, dammit. It's probably just some stupid sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:Because of your sin, people die}."""

{f:5:Beatrice},"""You do not carry it out directly. .........However, because you committed a sin, the cogs of fate were sent astray, spun a full six years, and due to the deviation that resulted, ......tonight, this many lives are lost."""

Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Oh, ......come the fuck on!! {i:I'm} the cause?! Then what?! Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?! Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Give me a fucking break!!! For these six years, I've been the man furthest from the Ushiromiya family! What influence could {i:I} have had on {i:anything} and how?!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to! I'd patched things up with the family after six years, so to like, draw a line under that whole period, I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!! It's not like I had some duty to come here today!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I came back, and because of that a tragedy occurred? Then what?! You're saying that if I hadn't come back, no one would've had to die?!"""

Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Sorry, but I don't have a goddamn clue."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".............................."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Look. ......I'm starting to get a little pissed off. ......If there's something you wanna say, then say it. If you have a grudge against me, you just have to come out and say it. ......Don't be nasty about it and demand for me to remember."""

,"The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself, and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained."
,"She was certainly identical, the same witch, .........but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice‐cold, ......a far cry from the one before, who, though apparently drunk, had at least been in high spirits."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............Hey!! Are you listening?! That's enough for that test thing, right?! I don't give a crap whether I passed or failed! The only thing that's gonna help the way I'm feeling is bashing you in the face!! Get the hell down here!! Or else open up this door...!!"""
,The witch said nothing back.
,Her eyes were as ice‐cold as Battler's shoulders.
,......She was clearly a different person from the one who had first appeared on that balcony.
,"The witch looked hard into my eyes, ......and gave two small shakes of the head."
,"Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment..."
,"Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels."
,"After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him........."
,The study was in the middle of a lively party.
,"It seemed that Gaap was making fun of {f:5:Virgilia}, teasing her over some stupid triviality."
,"...They were spitting ""Lialialia"", ""Gapgapgap"" at each other."
,Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle and were enjoying the show.
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oh, you're back. How were the results of Battler's test?!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Maria's test got passing marks with no complaints, I'll have you know? I've long held her in contempt as a worthless little urchin, but lo and behold, surprise surprise, {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} my, not bad, not bad, not bad indeed! Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"""
,It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.{n}He laughed towards Beato with the same level of excitation as the time they'd left for the tests.
,"...However, Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} instantly noticed the change in her enthusiasm."
,Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, {f:5:Beatrice}, my beloved witch? Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side? Let's go out in the pouring rain and roast a cow whole, oohhh, not a bad idea!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ronove, make the preparations right away! {f:5:Beatrice}, let's leave the results of Battler's test for later. Why don't we have a toast with spare ribs first, uwa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................Roast yourself whole."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""‐ha‐hah‐hah‐hah, ......what?"""
,"As Kinzo doubled over laughing in a great mood, the witch who had spoken bluntly passed him coldly by."
,"......Then, behind the witch's back, .........the old summoner's body suddenly went up in flames..."
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Gyuoaaaaooaahhh!!!! Gwohh, gah, ......gyah.........w...h...y............?!"""
,"While spitting crimson flames from his eyes, mouth, nose...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around."
,"......Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn't burn anything except Kinzo."
,Kinzo didn't have a clue what was going on.
,"......He rolled around, unable to understand why {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been in such a good mood, had suddenly turned so cold......"
,The dancing silhouettes of witches and demons created by that massive rolling torch...looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.
,"However, the eyes of the demons watching over it were indifferent......"
,"When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch‐black corpse."
,The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain......
Ronove,"""......What has happened, Milady?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It has lost its thrill. .........Clean up those bothersome cinders."""
,{f:5:Beatrice}'s expression......was unbelievably apathetic.
,...There was an iciness there that told the others that they risked the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.
Gaap,"""............Y‐yes. I will do it..."""
,Gaap made a jet‐black pitfall swallow up Kinzo's cinders.
,"...If she hadn't carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned. You could feel that thirst for blood."
,"No, a thirst for blood probably isn't the best way to describe it."
,......Just like humans don't have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while walking.
,"......That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn't hesitate to bury a passerby..."
{f:5:Virgilia},"""......Wh‐what is it, Beato?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I don't want to answer. ...............No, I can't even be bothered to answer any more."""
Gaap,""".........What is it? This isn't like you. ......Did something happen? Did Battler say someth—"""
Gaap,""".........k...g...gyhh—"""
,{f:5:Beatrice} hadn't even responded. It seemed that she had even ignored it.
,But there was a change in Gaap.
,"From her feet, a crackling, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking, ......and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture."
{f:5:Virgilia},"""G‐......Gaap..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............Disappear for a while. I'm in a very bad mood."""
,"{f:5:Beatrice} spoke in a truly cold voice, ......which froze the heart just to hear it."
Ronove,"""......Certainly. In that case, please allow us to retire. .........If you need anything, call at any time."""
,"After a single bow, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and hid himself."
,"{f:5:Virgilia} turned Gaap from a sculpture into a group of gold butterflies, and then turned into a cloud of them herself, which mixed in with the others and disappeared."
,"............In the study made untidy by drinking, ......{f:5:Beatrice} stood still, alone."
,"Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn't changed in the slightest..."
,"......However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates, her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased."
,"And when she whispered ""disappear"", in that instant, the room flashed, and was tidy again, as though nothing had ever happened."
,"The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.{n}There were no stains where things had been spilled, nor was there any scattered trash."
,"......To the contrary, even the air had frozen over, and, enough to make one doubt whether so many noisy people really had been in this room until just moments ago, .........the study had returned to total silence."
,".........In that silent, ......frigid study where even the air had frozen, {f:5:Beatrice} stood still..."
,"Then, she called him in a mutter."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................Battler. Are you there?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I've been here for a while. .........What the hell's going on with you? You've been acting strange."""

Ushiromiya Battler,"""With what?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............I've had enough, now."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wha? .........Well, uh, you were the one who cooked up this game. Heh, if you've had enough, that's great for me. So basically, you're resigning?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I am not resigning. I am just ending it. No, I won't even end it. The game will simply be abandoned for all eternity."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Pretty sure they call that resigning. ......Man, the words ""got tired of it and threw it away"" fit you perfectly."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Precisely. I am tired of it and am throwing it away. I don't care about the rest. It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as it likes."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................ ......What's up with you? You've been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Are you still sour over that baffling test? If you've got something against me, all you have to do is say it clearly."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that's got to be a play on words, right? It's written all over your face. You have a grudge against me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you'll understand? At the time you left your sin behind, I did not exist."""
,"As Beato spoke with an irritated expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased."
,Fickle. Inconsistent. Moody. Temperamental. ......Selfish and simple‐minded and cruel.
,"But even so, she had never shown an expression as strange as this even once before now..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Well, you were the one who instigated this game. I'm a bit let down that it won't get resolved, but feel free to invite me again sometime if you feel like it. But when that time comes, allow me to politely decline, alright? Heheheh."""
