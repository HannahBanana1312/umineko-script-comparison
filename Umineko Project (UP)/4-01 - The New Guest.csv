Ronove,"""Good morning, Milady. My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood. What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""‘Pleasant awakening’...! I was so excited, I couldn't sleep a wink. After all, the curtain is rising on the oh‐so‐fun fourth game...!"""
,It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn't gotten any sleep.
,"And yet she showed absolutely no signs of tiredness; was that due to her youth, or her low mental age?"
,"Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed with a {nobreak:""pu ku ku""} instead."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I really ran that Battler into the ground last time! Ah, that look of ""you tricked meee"" all over his face! He looked so pathetic! In any case, I do hope he's not still feeling down?"""
Ronove,"""Feeling down, you say...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mm, well, how to put it. ...You know how he is a bit too sincere for his age?"""
Ronove,"""Indeed I do. Although one could call that his charm. Pu ku ku..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*! You could, you certainly could! Well, speaking of that. You know how he completely fell for the thing I pulled the last time?"""
Ronove,"""Oh, yes, completely and splendidly. ...His pure, rosebud‐like innocence, arising from never once having been tricked by another since birth, you unreservedly violated."""
Ronove,"""............Even the joy of running around a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it utterly wouldn't even begin to compare."""
Ronove,"""You took Battler‐sama's innocent heart, Milady, and thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and in quite the uncultured manner, enough to make one think ""maybe I went a teensy little bit overboard...?"", you most assuredly perpetrated the very worst of atrocities against it."""
Ronove,"""I am quite sure most people {i:would} start to feel down. Pukkukukuku, so much so, that I doubt they would ever want to see your face again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""S‐so you understand...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I also, umm, considering that the fourth game is finally getting underway, I thought that it would be such a pain if he was so disheartened that he wouldn't join us at the table, and so, you see, I asked you first, thinking that it would be better to prepare a countermeasure beforehand...!"""
Ronove,"""Hmmmm... In that case, indeed, I do think you would be well served to prepare such a countermeasure. Most unfortunately, due to your ""North Wind and the Sun Strategy"", it appears that Battler‐sama has received quite a shock."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""H‐hoh... ......A shock, you say... How badly...?"""
,"Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly.{n}Ronove went along with that, and lowered his voice in the same way."
Ronove,"""......In truth, he has been curled into a ball clutching his knees for some time now. I called out to him several times, but he did not answer. I also carried him something to eat, but he does not appear to have touched it."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Th‐that is...troublesome...... Is he really feeling that down......?"""
Ronove,"""Pukkukukuku. It is only natural. ...After all, you {nobreak:com‐pre‐hensively} destroyed him, Milady. That would turn most anyone into a misanthrope."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh, distrust of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s? How convenient! Let him give up on {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and trust witches, wahahaha... ...............O‐...oh, *cough*. Sorry, I took it too far."""
,"Beato had tried to joke about it, but it seemed that the situation was quite serious, and after picking up on this, she hid her laughter."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Is it really that serious...? Sh‐should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?"""
Ronove,"""Because Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s guest will be coming, it may be more appropriate to open the fourth game quickly. However, it might be useful if you were to show him a little consideration, Milady."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Consideration! Consideration, you say?! How should I show that...?! He is feeling down, so, ...h‐how about...I cheer him up, or something?!"""
Ronove,"""When a person's heart is closed off to the light, it is useless to interact with them in a gloomy fashion. You can do nothing but shine with a brightness stronger than the dark."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!"""
Beelzebub,"""Kyaahhahaha!! Battler‐kuun, over he~re! A croissant baked by Ronove‐sama would be wasted on the likes of youuuu! Maybe I'll enjoy it aaalll myself?"""
,Battler's stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant.
,"His breakfast plate was empty, but he hadn't eaten any of it.{n}...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away."
,"Battler had discovered her in the process, and they had been charging about causing a crazy amount of noise ever since."
,"Even though Beelzebub could have ended it by either giving it back already or else throwing it into her own mouth, she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Give me my breakfast back, damn iiiiiiit!! If you give it back now, I'll let you off with a single flick to the forehead. But just you try eating it!!"""
Beelzebub,"""What, are you gonna eat me inste~ad?! Kyaha! Try it if you think you can! I'll bet I'd be as sweet as honey pancakes. ...kya!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Gotcha!! Right now, I'm more interested in that bread than your thighs. Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere, fugagigigigi...!! So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!"""
Beelzebub,"""Ugugugugu!! No way, no way, I won't give it to yo~u!! Even the croissant wants me to eat i~~t!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Y‐yaa~y, yoo‐hooooooooo, g'moooooorning, Battleeee~r!! Get a load of this guy, first thing in the morning and he's back to moping already~?!?! It's the beginning of a new day, and a new game, you know, so get your spirits up and let's get this party starte{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeddd!!"""
,...The door opened forcefully.
,"Like a marathon runner drawn on a {c:86EF9C:certain caramel box}, with her hands held high and with an idiotic cheeriness, ......Beato appeared."
,"For some reason, countless country flags and confetti scattered everywhere, creating what was clearly intended to be the perfect party atmosphere."
,"......Battler and Beelzebub, who had been grappling on the floor over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument and stared at her speechless."
Beelzebub,"""Kya‐...kyahahahaha! Good morning, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama! Well, that's all for me! Here, Battler‐kun, say aa~h!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Mggmffff!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Mmmffmmmff, *munch*munch*, ...*gulp*. ..................... ......H‐hey, morning, Beato... ......Glad to see you're in perfect form this morning."""
,....................................
,Beato and Battler looked at each other.{n}...It seemed that neither had a clue what was going on with the other.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""B‐......Battlerr......? Wh‐wh‐what is this, Ronoveeeee, he looks like he's in high spiriiiiiiits!! He isn't clutching his knees! And he's answering! {i:And} he was even in the middle of eating!!"""
Ronove,"""Pukkukukukuku!! No, no, he certainly was clutching his knees, under the blanket as he slept like a baby. I informed him that it was time for him to wake up, but he just wouldn't get out of bed. As for his food, it seems that he was rather too preoccupied with the naughty cat that had wandered in. Pu ku ku, puu ku ku ku ku!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""G‐.........gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!! You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh, you should talk. Weren't you the one who played that massive trick on me last time? I don't have a clue what's going on, but I'm glad to see you started your morning with a helping of just deserts. ...Well, anyway, nice one, Ronove."""
Ronove,"""Pukkukuku, I am much obliged, Battler‐sama."""
,"The two stuck up their thumbs as though they had forged some kind of male bond, chuckling together."
,"For a while, Beato acted very energetically, trying to hide her embarrassment......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh. Don't take me so lightly. You thought I'd still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*. Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time? I should've collected your copious tears in a bottle and used it as eau de toilette."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sh‐shut up. That was, uh, you got me a bit with your crappy acting and crazy plot twist, that's all. I made an ass of myself, but you'd better not think that same move is ever gonna work again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Naturally. Don't disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, alright? *cackle*cackle*!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ihihi, yeah, just you watch. I'll teach you that I'm a guy who gets stronger every time he's beaten down."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............But Beato."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mm, what is it?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Never do it again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh? And why is thaaat? So you really are weak against the rear attack?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............You and I are enemies, and we'll never, ever join forces. ...I now understand that clearly. ......So never again do something as unpleasant as trying to make me confused about that fact."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*! You say that, but now that I know it's your weak point, ........."""
,"Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that had disappeared from Battler's expression some time ago."
,Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea gone cold...
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You hear me? Never do it again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".................. ......You never know... I might do it again when you've forgotten..."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Never do it again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............nn, ..............."""
,"Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue."
,She may have thought that Battler would surely be the one to break that silence with laughter.
,"...However, Battler's serious expression didn't change in the slightest."
,"So, to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!! As things should be. You and I are worthy adversaries. No matter how favorable our relationship, we shall never cross that line defining us as enemies. If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...That's right. I almost forgot that you were my enemy for just a second. I won't show such a disgraceful display again. ......I won't fall for your rear attack again. Ever...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................... ...Heh! Hahhahahyahhahha!! It seems that I am not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game. I am pleased, Battler. Come, take your seat."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Sure. Bring it on. ......Clever little tricks aren't gonna work anymore."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Stop acting so tough. You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo's murder...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........I'm still holding off on an answer for that one. But that doesn't mean I've lost heart. I will break your ""red truth"" and deny witches—I guarantee it...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hmph. A good disposition. You truly are a man like a phoenix. You don't betray my expectations! With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""But before that, it seems that we must welcome a new guest."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""A guest......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I am sure you must remember. That mystery woman, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation and spoiled my performance."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Her........."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""She says that she wants to join our game, you see. I took the liberty of sending her an official invitation to join us. Ronove, call the guest."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......There's no need. I'm already here."""
,The voice that answered Beato's call came from the darkness in a corner of the room.
,Battler turned around in surprise to discover that the mysterious woman was suddenly there.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Goodness gracious. How rude. If you were here, the least I would have expected is a simple greeting."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't make a habit of greeting people before punching them. But I will give one after I punch."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh, and what will that be?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""<Good night, have a nice dream>."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*, hahhahhahahahahahaha! Entertaining, truly entertaining...!"""
,Beato cackled and clapped her hands.
,"But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler's face except an uncertain smile."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Whew. So you're the ""punch first, ask questions later"" type, huh."""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".............................."""
,"Battler met eyes with the woman, shrugging his shoulders as he spoke.{n}But the woman didn't answer, giving only a cold stare in return."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You helped me out last game when things were really coming down to the wire. I'm grateful."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't need gratitude. The way you were acting was just {i:flaccid}. I only told you to get a clue."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kuhhyahhyahhya! Yesss, Battler is flaccid indeed, hyahhyahha!"""
,"Beato tried to laugh in agreement, but the woman wasn't listening."
,She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice‐cold eyes.
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............Well, it looks like someone hates me."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'm just annoyed that you aren't fighting seriously."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You say I'm not serious......?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You can't possibly mean that the mess you got yourself into earlier was you being {i:serious}? ......What do you take me for? How long do you intend to go along with this witch's farce?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I am fighting Beato in my own way. And yes, I'm serious about it."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Serious? .........Don't make me laugh. You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously? Keep the jokes to just your hairstyle."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I mean, sure, I wasn't used to this witch's game in the beginning, and I've had a hell of a rough time, I'll admit. But now, I'm finally starting to see how to fight and the knack to doing it. ...If the pathetic way I've been acting makes it look to you like I haven't been serious, you're mistaken."""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Am I?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Of course, I know I've gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But no matter how long that distance is, it is finite. And with each passing game, I am steadily closing that distance step by step!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""No matter how long it takes, I will close in on that witch, and I'll definitely checkmate her. ......Borrowing one of her common phrases, it might even take me ""a thousand years"". ...But even so, eventually, I will definitely win."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Why? Because I will never accept losing. I will never stand still, and I'll keep closing in on her! So in other words, there's just one thing I can say for sure."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I will definitely win against that witch someday! That's how it is."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You sure are patient. Are you even trying to win? Even the finite can become infinite if it's treated the wrong way. You've already become Achilles, unable to even outstrip a tortoise."""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Now I get it. So this is why I'm needed. At this rate, there's no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Who are you? It wouldn't kill you to tell me your name."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""................................."""
,"At that point, the woman fell silent, gazing straight into Battler's eyes."
,"At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look and his gaze wavered slightly, but as her eyes continued to stare into his, gradually, he found himself becoming lost in them."
,"......And in their depths, he saw a light that he had seen at some time before..."
,"Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn't be here, ......but that was completely impossible."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I know it's stupid, ......but for some reason, I'm getting that feeling. But that can't be right. ......She's supposed to still be six years old. ............You couldn't possibly be............Ange, could you............?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""........................ If I said yes, ...would you believe me?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Nn..............."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'll put it another way. If I said ""I am on your side, so trust me"", would you believe me? Would you unconditionally trust some unknown woman you're meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......It's because you're so trusting that you were tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......You said it yourself. That kid is six, right? Do I look like I'm six? And despite that, if I were to claim that I'm that kid, you'd still just swallow that story?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......When you put it like that, ...I guess you're right."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Sorry. Yeah, I am too trusting. The last game should have taught me that. ......Is this what you meant when you said I wasn't serious?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yes. You may think you're fighting against the witch, but all you're doing is making friends with her and having fun. ......You're just competing in a friendly game of chess."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That may be a serious contest for you two, but looking at it from far away, I only see you two playing around like you're good friends, protected by the rules."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..................... ......Ihihihi. That's harsh."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""But as long as you can't win this game, you won't be released from this place. ......That's why I came. To bring this game to its conclusion. ......You claim that you're closing in on the witch, but you're just like a hamster running around in a wheel."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*! Oh, those? Those things that run around and around in a wheel night after night?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless. ......Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. You are just like that wheel. And he is the one running around in the wheel forever, thinking he's fighting, but actually just making a fool of himself."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......This isn't a game. This is nothing more than a cage to keep him imprisoned for all eternity."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh. ......You would liken my infinity to a mere wheel that a mouse plays in? Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Something that's infinite in a certain dimension tends not to be infinite in a higher one. A Menger sponge may have infinite surface area, but that only applies in a world of less than three dimensions. In the three‐dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass. Not only is it not infinite, it can't even exist."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! What an assertive woman. It seems you are worthy of calling yourself my enemy."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Who...are you?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I am your ally. And an enemy of witches. .........Of course, you don't have to believe it."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No one can prove that I really am your ally. In fact, it would be preferable if you stayed on your guard strongly enough to find me very suspicious."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........You're right. I got burned bad the last time. I've got to be at least that careful. ...I'm done with getting tricked."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*......!"""
,Beato laughed with true satisfaction in a way that was insulting only to Battler.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""People don't just get tricked out of the blue. They neglect to check things for themselves, and entrust that to other people—and that's when they get tricked. ......Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing is no excuse for getting into an accident. Get it...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah... I get it. ......You're telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself. .........I've just been swallowing the magic that Beato showed me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{i:I'd stopped thinking}. That's why it was no good."""
,"Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses. ...Seeing that, the witch laughed audaciously once again."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I will advise you in a way that will be to your advantage. Of course, you shouldn't just swallow the things I say. Because no one can provide absolute proof that I'm on your side."""
,"In the last game, {f:5:Virgilia}, who I'd thought was an ally, turned out to be on the witch's side after all."
,"......Battler couldn't get that eerie smile worn by {f:5:Virgilia}, who he had even thought of as dependable, out of his head."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""So you don't have to unconditionally trust me. Therefore, taking my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered is absolutely fine. After all, ......the player who's fighting in a game against the witch {i:is you}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Yeah, you're right. Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed it would! My opponent is Battler. You are nothing more than an outsider. It is good that you understand that. *cackle*!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No, I'm not an outsider. {f:5:Beatrice}, Ushiromiya Battler, ...and me with my bird's‐eye perspective over you...will fight in a formation almost like a triangle. At a glance it might not seem to be a united front, but fighting together is not the only way to form a united front."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh. What an odd thing to say."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance. But you can't measure distance with a single eye. Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be measured."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......And having two viewpoints is meaningless if they're in the same place. You can gauge the witch more accurately if they're far apart."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Shooting from different positions and different angles. ...So, like crossfire, then. Heheh, interesting."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""We will shoot from different positions...and different angles. ......So I won't make friends with anybody. In order to separate my own position and catch the witch in a pincer attack."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Are you sure about this, Battlerr? This woman may actually be an ambush I set up, you know? She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, you know...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Maybe. She's been saying that over and over again herself. ...So, of course, I can't blindly accept her advice."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But I can think for myself and decide whether it's worthy of being trusted or not. As long as I don't stop thinking for myself, I won't be tricked by anyone again...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! Impressive confidence, Ushiromiya Battleerr! After you've said so much, it makes me want to...trick you all over again, you see...? And I want to see what kind of face you'll make when you realize that you've been tricked yet again! I like it, kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......So, it looks like you know my name, but I don't know yours. ...Tell me your name."""
,"For a while, the woman remained silent without the slightest change in her expression."
,"...She looked as though she couldn't decide whether to say her name or not, or possibly, as though she was deciding what to call herself on the spot."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Gretel."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Girdle? You wear one?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That's my name, dumbass. Call me Gretel."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then should I call myself Hansel? Ihihihi, just kidding, I'm Ushiromiya Battler! Just call me Battler."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............Nice to meet you. ...I hate handshakes. Don't take it personally."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Yeah, you're right, sorry. I mean, it isn't a sure thing that you're on my side. ......And you only just told me to keep my guard up, too."""
,Battler drew back the right hand he had stuck out.
,"His bitter smile disappeared, and was replaced with a strong expression of resolve for the new game, now in its fourth iteration."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Battler. ......Think deeply about why you must win against this witch. ......You can't stop with something abstract, like ""She annoys me so she's going down"". ......Have a deep conviction that you'll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world."""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Because there is definitely.........someone waiting for you to come back. ......For her sake as well, you.............................."""
,"Maybe she had something on her mind. Gretel clenched a fist in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while."
,"Beato spoke up in a forceful voice, shattering that silence."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever! Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4th! Kuhhihihihihihihi, the curtain opens on the fourth game!!"""
,"In unison with her voice, the clock, which had been turned back to October 4th, 1986, ......started to move, as though blown by a suddenly raging storm."
,"While we remained in the witch's tea room, the blue‐gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us, ......and we could see the boat heading there, trailing a wake behind it."
,"The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away."
,"The boat docked in the harbor, .........and Gohda, who had been waiting there, could be seen helping to unload it."
,"And finally, ......the boat dropped off all of the passengers, .........and began to separate from the island."
,The relatives started to get swallowed up by the island.
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Ahhahahaha! You're as energetic as ever, Maria."""
Ushiromiya George,"""Maria‐chan, you'll trip if you don't look out. Be careful...!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu‐uu‐uu!! Gonna faaall gonna faaall, gonna siiink gonna siiink, *giggle*!"""
,"...All my fondly remembered cousins I had loved so much dashed away through the beach, ......disappearing as they were sucked into the forest path leading to the mansion."
,"And of course, Onii‐chan could be seen among them too."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Dammii~it!! Hold it, hold it, Mariaaaa!! You nimble little brat!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""*giggle*! Uu‐uu‐uu! *giggle*giggle*!"""
,"Maria onee‐chan, who I had loved, dashed away, and Onii‐chan chased after her."
,They were swallowed up by the forest.
,"Following in pursuit, Mom and Dad were also swallowed up."
,"The rest of my relatives were swallowed up, too..."
,"......Swallowed up, leaving only me behind..."
Ushiromiya Ange,You idiot......
Ushiromiya Ange,How long are you going to joke around and play with a witch in a place like this......
Ushiromiya Ange,"Come back quickly, ......Onii‐chan......!{n}Don't leave me all alone...!"
Ushiromiya Ange,And realize.
Ushiromiya Ange,Realize what a cruel and lonely world I end up isolated in...
