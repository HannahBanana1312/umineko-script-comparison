Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......{f:5:Beatrice}. I have been calling to you for a while. Did you not hear me...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Hmm. Were you? My apologies. I was lost in my thoughts. Forgive me."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""The weather is pleasant. ...I see, I can understand how the weather has stolen your heart. Will you drink your black tea here...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...............Who...am I?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""................................. ......I will bring some black tea now. Wait here for a while."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Forget about the black tea. Talk with me."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Very well."""
,Kinzo had used the excuse of going to bring some black tea to try and interrupt the conversation for the time being. ...But his attempt had been very transparent.
,"I sat in the garden chair, and beckoned Kinzo to do the same.{n}Kinzo sat down heavily, exaggerating his age."
,"For a while, we sat, appreciating the silence..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Who am I? To this day, no one has answered me this question. ......For some reason, everyone averts their gaze and evades me."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""........................"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......I have known you for a long time. I think of you as my best friend, even as a father. ......That is why I want so much for you to tell me. You must know. ...Who I am."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".................. ............Why do you worry about something like that? You are {f:5:Beatrice}. The master of this mansion, is that not so? ......What more could you want to know?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............I do not know."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""What's this? ......Don't you even understand yourself what it is you want to know? That is baffling. In my younger days, I sometimes found myself wanting to play in the maze of thought that has no exit. Maybe that is what your worries are..."""
,"Kinzo laughed as though it was a trivial matter. ...However, I couldn't help but feel that this behavior was nothing but another attempt to force me to stop my further questioning."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................... ...Hmph. ......So not even you will tell me that...after all."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""There is nothing to tell. You are {f:5:Beatrice}. Isn't that more than enough?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......No, that's not it. ............What I wish to know is not my name. It is...who...I am."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Who am I, what am I? ...How long have I been here, ...and how long will I continue my days here?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""........................ ...I really should bring some black tea. Do you not think it a waste of all this fine weather?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""................................."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........What is this all about...? Somehow, it looks like the story of your past, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It appears so. ...To think that we would go this far back..."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wondering who you were... ...It looks like you had some pretty high‐minded worries."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......That is to be expected. At the time, I was unable to understand who I was, or why I was alive."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Well, in puberty, everyone is captured by those philosophical worries, wondering what meaning there is to their life, at least once. Doesn't this just mean that you had this kind of charming period once in your life?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................... ...I had been in that mansion since the time I was born. And I lived only inside the mansion. Of course, I was able to go out into the garden, but the area around the mansion was surrounded by a very tall fence, which I was unable to leave through, and I would be told severely that I mustn't leave."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......I could walk freely throughout the mansion and the garden, but my desire to take just one step outside those of my own accord was never granted."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............What do you mean by that? ...Are you trying to say that, for as long as you can remember, you were always a bird in a cage?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......I thought that was just how things were. After all, I had been living like that as far back as I could remember. I didn't even think to question it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What in the world............are you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That's it. That is what I also hoped to know."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Heh. I'm sure you'll say something like ""I wasn't a human, I was a witch"", right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No, that's not correct. Not {i:yet} correct. ......Or, should I say, it was {i:once} correct. ......I was constructed by Kinzo, a human built by a human. ...No, maybe I should call it a cage made of flesh."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What's that supposed to mean...? ...This is starting to sound weird."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......You probably won't believe it anyway. Listen first. .........I was a great witch who had lived for one thousand years. But at some time, I was summoned by Kinzo, ...and by his hidden arts, I was bound as his prisoner for eternity."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Never heard that before. From what we hear in the Ushiromiya family, you were summoned by Grandfather, made something like a devil's contract with him, and gave him the gold."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. That is correct. ...Then I was supposed to hide myself until the contract was over. But, .........well, it's tough being a popular woman. .........By some turn of events, Kinzo fell in love with me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Grandfather's nearsightedness must have gotten pretty bad. With astigmatism too, ihihi. To fall in love with you, of all things."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Hmph. Well, to me it was supremely annoying."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...However, the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is a frightening thing. He exhibited fearsome power and rooted me to this place. ...He said I wouldn't be freed until I nodded my head in agreement. ...Such an overbearing man."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Isn't that awesome. Everyone knows Grandfather's obsessed with the occult, but......who knew he had the power to root down the Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Heh, ridiculous. You think I'd believe such a weird story?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...As I thought, you don't believe."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""All I believe is the fact that you lived in this hidden mansion in the middle of the forest. You are the 19th person on Rokkenjima, right?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Indeed. Just as you imagine, this is deep in the forest of Rokkenjima. A hidden mansion not to be found from the outside world. Its name is {ruby:Nine Birds' Retreat:Kuwadorian}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Come to think of it, I heard that the guesthouse's real name was {ruby:Visitor's Retreat:Toraian}. ...I see, the naming sense is similar. ......So, you were Grandfather's lover, who lived here in secret. Isn't that right?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Lover isn't the right way to say it. ......You should probably call it Kinzo's unrequited love. I spoke of it just recently, correct? He fell in love with me of his own accord. He then courted me, but I rejected him."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Then, I was shut up in this hidden mansion. .........No, I shouldn't say that I was shut up in the mansion. ......It would be more correct to say that I was shut up in this body."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............I have no idea what you just said at the end there."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You will just make fun of it and not listen, right? After all, you say that you don't believe in witches or magic. If you have no ears to hear what I tell you, saying it would be the pinnacle of foolishness."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................... ......I'll decide whether I believe or not. ...After all, if I don't hear it, the story won't move on. Tell me. ...The story of your past."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Alright. .........I refused Kinzo when he courted me, but he was not a man to lose heart just because of that. He wanted to get my consent no matter what. He shut me up in this mansion, and spent an eternity trying to win my heart."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...He really is overbearing. No one likes a man who can't take a hint, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........*cackle*cackle*. Regardless of whether I responded to his courting or not, to make a man so desperate for me was...well, as a woman, it wasn't unpleasant."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......However, I never nodded my head. I tried what I could to escape his restrictions, but that barrier was firm, and I couldn't break it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......And then?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""After trying to resist in various ways, I eventually reached the conclusion that, to escape from Kinzo's barrier, I would have to throw away my body of flesh. ......The physical body is a vessel which carries many restrictions in terms of magic."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Throw away your body of flesh......? What's that? Something like an out‐of‐body experience?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Well, if you want to think of it that way. However, I am not a spirit. Even though I am a witch, in the beginning, I was born with a human's body of flesh. So for me, throwing away that physical body, while it didn't mean the same thing as death, did require a corresponding level of resolve."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So in other words, ......you made up your mind that you couldn't be released except by suicide, is that what you mean?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It wasn't suicide. It was nothing more than throwing away my body of flesh. ......Of course, becoming nothing more than soul is a precarious situation. When the soul leaves its body of flesh, it is constantly exposed to the strong winds of the sun. It was not easy even for me to maintain myself and avoid being scattered by them."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It was a final measure that I wanted to avoid if I could. However, there was no other way to break through Kinzo's barrier."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......*cackle*, after all, I am a free spirit. I couldn't stand being kept in a cage until Kinzo's life was over."""
,"I couldn't understand this story Beato kept going on about, about throwing away her body of flesh, as anything more than suicide."
,"Grandfather persistently courted her, and to escape from that, ......she chose her own death...?"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............So you're saying you committed suicide? What are you saying? Isn't that you, sitting carefree there in the garden chair?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......That's right. That is the new cage I was given by Kinzo."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Cage? You mean this mansion?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No. I mean my body, relaxing in the garden chair over there. .........After I became a soul and tried to escape, even then, Kinzo had no intention of allowing me to escape."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Yes, indeed, he is a frightening person. Normally, seeing the woman of your one‐sided desires take her own life should be enough to bring anyone to their senses, even if their love was a hundred years old. ......I suppose it makes him somewhat of a mage after all. ......*cackle*."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't try to speak in riddles with that incomprehensible witch‐girl talk. ...In short, what are you trying to say?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That Kinzo didn't let me escape even after I became a soul. ......Human emotions are terrifying. That he would be able to exhibit this much power..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Tying down a spirit of the dead...is not a level readily attained, even for a mage seeking that as his specialty. Because I knew that, Kinzo's fearful magical power shocked me then for the first time."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............Then Kinzo seized my soul and brought me back. However, a cage to hold a seized soul cannot be made, not from iron nor from lead. ......There is but one exception."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............What? You aren't going to say it was a magical cage or something, are you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wrong. That body of flesh over there, just like yours or mine. ...Only a cage made of flesh and blood can tie a spirit down to this world. ......Kinzo shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh built to be exactly like me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..................... ...So in summary, is it something like this? Grandfather persistently courted you, you started to hate it, and you committed suicide, but you weren't clever enough to finish the job? ...Damn, you really took a roundabout way to say something like that."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""No, that's wrong. My soul was shut up in the seed of a homunculus, and I was born out of a test tube."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Huh?! Ridiculous...! That's goddamn impossible and you know it!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Kinzo accomplished even the miracle of creating life. And only to shut my soul up in that cage. ......That he would show such magical power simply because of his own love... A thoroughly terrifying person."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aah, okay, it's really gotten to the point of ridiculousness now! Say whatever you want. I won't believe a word of it. Just do what you like, for hell's sake."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...............mh. ...What is this unpleasant attitude?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh, in the beginning, I showed a little interest, thinking there might be some huge hint hidden, but the more I hear, the weirder this story starts to get. This is supposed to be a game about denying witches, but I get the feeling that I'm suddenly being made to just swallow a witch story."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sorry, but I don't feel like listening to this any more. Just keep rambling on to yourself as much as you want. I'll just be here digging out some earwax or something."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................... ......Hmph."""
,"When I started showing a cold attitude, Beato acted unusually discouraged."
,"Of course, her expression was still brazen...but I had the feeling that I was able to catch a glimpse of loneliness because I hadn't found the story of her past interesting, in that really easy to understand expression of hers."
,"......For some reason, that slight reaction made her seem pitiful, so even though I kept my couldn't‐care‐less attitude, I decided to humor her slightly."
,"Damn it, even though she's an irritating witch, I'm still weak against her because her chromosomes are XX..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Well, I have absolutely no desire to believe you, but, ............keep going. I'll listen to your story in place of cookies."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So you treat the story of my past like cookies. ......You think that if you abuse me like that, I will just casually tell you...?"""
,"After I made fun of her, Beato reacted a little sensitively."
,"It looked like, even though making fun of people was her specialty, she was horrible at being made fun of by other people."
,"Just then, my cup of black tea suddenly made a sound, surprising me."
Ronove,"""......Milady's soul was seized and breathed into a cage of new life. In other words, Milady received life as a human once more."""
,"Before I had realized it, the demon butler had appeared and taken my cup, and was adding more black tea to it."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ronove. That is enough of that story. He says that it is too ridiculous to listen to. I now also feel ridiculous and have no intention of speaking."""
Ronove,"""Some new cookies are currently being baked. I thought that, until then, the story of Milady's past would be a perfect substitute. Pu ku ku...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I, ...I already said that I've had enough of talking about me! You are both unpleasant people. I'm leaving! Ronove, leave as soon as you are done serving. No idle talking with Battler."""
Ronove,"""Certainly. I will make an effort."""
,"Beato's confusing female short temper took hold of her, and she turned her body into gold butterflies, scattered, and disappeared."
,"After that, only Ronove and the scent of the black tea were left..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I feel kind of bad for making her angry."""
Ronove,"""It appears that you are aware of it, so there is nothing more to be said."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wait a second. Weren't you the one that pushed her over the edge?"""
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku ku. My, whatever could you mean? Would you care for some sugar and milk?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Just milk will be fine. ............And I also want some cookies."""
Ronove,""".........You are aware that baking the cookies will take some more time?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""There's a substitute, you said?"""
Ronove,"""......Certainly. If you would listen quietly, I will continue the story."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""She said something about a homunculus. ...I know a bit about that. It's that thing, right? A manufactured human created with alchemy or something?"""
Ronove,"""Yes. Milady's soul was shut up in a homunculus, and she was revived into this world, receiving life again as a baby. ......However, because she was a baby, even if Kinzo tried to profess his love to her, it would be useless."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................ .........You aren't saying.........Grandfather shut that baby up in this hidden mansion, until it grew to reach the same age?!"""
Ronove,"""Yes. That is what I am saying. However, while her soul was the same, a human spirit receives a strong influence from its vessel. Milady lost all of her memories of the past, and grew up as a very normal human girl."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""And you're saying......that's the Beato sitting in the garden chair?"""
Ronove,"""Yes. That is correct. She grew to be completely identical. However, she did not possess her power as a witch. ......I must stress that Milady was a human."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""................................."""
,"Beato, who was sitting in the garden chair, looking up at the sky, asked that same question again."
,She asked who she was.
,"...The meaning of those words was finally starting to click. She couldn't understand why she was living here, all locked up."
,"Grandfather had seized {f:5:Beatrice}'s soul, shut it up in a body of flesh, and then shut that up in a hidden mansion."
,"However, since she had lived here since the time she was born, she couldn't even understand who she was, or why she lived shut up in there..."
,"......W‐...wait, wait.{n}Who would take such a stupid story seriously?"
,"Why don't I change my interpretation?{n}...Essentially, couldn't it be something like this?"
,"Grandfather met {f:5:Beatrice}.{n}He then fell in love with her and courted her, but she didn't nod her head in agreement.{n}And so he got angry, and shut her up inside this hidden mansion."
,"{f:5:Beatrice} tried to escape, but no matter what she did, she couldn't succeed, ......so she finally chose her own death."
,"......And then, .........hmm."
,"...Maybe there was a girl that looked just like {f:5:Beatrice}, ...no, a baby."
,And Grandfather raised this child with care.
,But maybe Grandfather didn't view this child as his daughter.
,"""Shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh""."
,"Those words probably meant......that he didn't view this kid as her child, but as her reincarnation. Maybe that's what it meant."
,"If you interpret it that way, even a story that weird might make a little sense..."
,...No no no. This might be some bullshit Beato cooked up to confuse me.
,"As if I could accept any of this...!{n}In the first place, ...Kuwadorian, was it?{n}There's no proof whatsoever that a hidden mansion actually existed."
,Couldn't this be something she just fabricated on the spot?
Ronove,"""{p:1:A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima}. That is the place we were just talking about."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Huh? R‐...red?!"""
,Ronove used the red to say that Kuwadorian actually existed.
,...Did that mean the same thing as the red Beato used?
Ronove,"""Even if I am not much of one, I am a demon all the same. ...Please keep this a secret from Milady, yes?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Y‐......yeah!"""
,"Beato, who knew I would try to trip her up, had grown extremely cautious when using red."
,To think that Ronove could also use that red...
,"Of course, it's the red of a crafty man. I don't know how far I can accept it, but anyway, I might be able to get some hint out of it......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So that Beato relaxing in the garden of Kuwadorian, ...and that conversation she had with Grandfather, were the truth?"""
Ronove,"""Yes. It is the truth. In the past, {p:1:the pair actually had a conversation like that in this place}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Th‐thanks a lot. I'll ask for some more red. She said that she was born from a homunculus, but does that kind of unscientific, magical thing actually exist?!"""
Ronove,"""I am unable to answer that question. The reason is that it would cause a stalemate."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......A stalemate?? What do you mean?"""
Ronove,"""It's a chess term referring to a state in which, similar to a ""perpetual check"", any further progress in a game becomes impossible. This is the opposite of an endless repetition of moves, and refers to a situation in which all moves disappear, resulting in a kind of deadlock."""
Ronove,"""In chess this would lead to a draw, just as if there were a perpetual check. ...However, there is no draw in the game between you and Milady. Therefore, I am unable to answer in red any question that would bring about a stalemate."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........You're speaking in riddles by saying something I don't really understand, but when it comes down to it, you're just trying to trick me because you can't say in red that something magical like a homunculus exists, right?"""
Ronove,"""If I were to say in red that ""witches exist"", what would you do, Battler‐sama?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............mh. ......That's what we're having this big fight over whether or not to believe, right? If you told me that outright, there'd be nothing more to discuss. It'd be game over."""
Ronove,"""If I said ""witches exist"" in red, you would have no room for argument. However, since the reason would never have been made clear to you, Battler‐sama, you probably wouldn't accept it. However, after being told that in red, you would have no room for argument and would not have been shown any proof."""
Ronove,"""In this situation, Battler‐sama, even though you wouldn't be able to admit defeat, you would have no way to make a counterargument, and it would become a deadlock. Even though checkmate would not have been reached, no more moves would exist."""
Ronove,"""Since you would not be able to make your next move, it would never become Milady's turn, and the game would stop there for all eternity. As a result, Milady would be unable to force you to submit. ......That would be a deadlock situation."""
Ronove,"""In order to avoid that, I am unable to answer questions of this form in red."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......So, to cut to the chase, you mean that questions that leave no room for discussion are prohibited? Well, that makes sense, I guess. If I was told ""witches exist"" in red, I'd have to give up from the start."""
Ronove,"""I am pleased that you understand. I believe we might be able to work together if you ask a question of a different form."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Can you respond to the repetition request she dodged? About the number of people on this island."""
Ronove,"""If Milady held back on the request, then of course I cannot respond. As Milady's furniture, I am unable to act too forward."""
,"Ronove made an exaggerated gesture, trying to act like a loyal retainer. This guy's so shameless."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Tch. Just when I thought you might be useful."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I'll give up on that and search for a different question. ...That's right. I was forgetting to check something important. .........This is a story about Beato's memories, right? When did it happen? It couldn't be happening right now, right?"""
Ronove,"""Correct. {p:1:This is the world of 1967}. It is the world of 19 years ago."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Hmmmmm..."""
,Let's go through the story one more time.{n}I wonder if it couldn't be something like this.
,"Grandfather had a person with whom he fell in unrequited love, called {f:5:Beatrice}.{n}And he confined her in this hidden mansion and continually courted her.{n}But she was stubborn and didn't say yes."
,"Eventually, she grew pessimistic about being unable to escape from here...and probably, committed suicide."
,"......And then, ......her soul was put in a homunculus and......"
,"No, no, if I accept that, it's the same as accepting the witch."
,I can interpret that part like this.{n}She probably......left a daughter behind when she died.
,That talk about the soul being put in a new body...probably meant...that Grandfather raised that child believing it to be the reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}...
,"...In that case, Beato must have existed on this island for at least the last 19 years as the 19th person, and then......umm......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I'm starting to get confused. ...In any event, none of this leaves the realm of guesswork. The only thing that I can definitely say in red, is that in 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice} existed as a human. That's all."""
Ronove,"""That is correct. {p:1:In 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama existed as a human}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh, thank you. That really helps."""
Ronove,"""Congratulations. With this, you have made clear the existence of the piece known as the 19th person. The 19th human outside of the 18 who you can blame, just as you longed for."""
Ronove,"""......A sacrificial sheep that you can shift the blame of any crime onto. And you must be so glad that it is Milady. Pu ku ku ku."""
,Ronove laughed indiscreetly.
,"Somehow, I didn't like his phrasing, so I didn't feel like laughing along with him."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......That's right. Auntie Rosa said it. ......‘{f:5:Beatrice} is dead’? ""I killed her""? What does that mean...?"""
Ronove,"""As for that, it may be faster to see the actual circumstances rather than listen to me tell you. Let us advance the clock a little more."""
,"Ronove pulled a stylish pocket watch from his pocket, and made to wind the crown."
,"As soon as he did, I saw gold butterflies gather behind Ronove's back and take the form of a person."
,...Was it Beato?! I quickly realized that it was someone else.
,"It was her. That oldest sister of the Seven Stakes, who loved tormenting me more than anything else."
,"......If I don't think myself lucky to see that sexy ass, I won't be able to play along with their torture game..."
Lucifer,"""Ronove‐sama. So, you were still here. This is an urgent call from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."""
Ronove,"""My, my, what kind of urgent business could it be? ......It appears as though I have spent slightly too long chatting with you, Battler‐sama. Well then, Battler‐sama, if you will excuse me. Please continue to enjoy your game with Milady."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, yeah. I'll enjoy it as best as I can. ...'Cause the conversations are more lively with you than with Beato. And you use the red more graciously. Come talk again any time."""
Ronove,"""............Battler‐sama. Despite how I look, I am Milady's furniture. ...I cannot do something that Milady does not wish. What I said in red was something that normally should have come from Milady's mouth. ...I did nothing more than announce the red truth in Milady's place as she sulked."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So she really was sulking then? Ihihihi!"""
Ronove,"""Pu ku kuku."""
,"Seeing me and Ronove incomprehensibly hitting it off, that Seven Stakes chick cocked her head slightly."
Lucifer,"""Ronove‐sama. We are keeping {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama waiting. Let us hurry."""
Ronove,"""Yes, I will come immediately. Well then, Battler‐sama, I shall see you later. ......It appears that we have finally started getting along. As I thought, I have the feeling that we can become good friends."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If by that you mean partners at gossiping behind Beato's back."""
Lucifer,"""Ronove‐sama!"""
Ronove,"""Yes, yes. Then, if you will excuse me."""
,"Maybe it was because she really didn't like seeing him act friendly with me, or maybe it was because she had really been told to hurry."
,"The Seven Stakes babe bellowed sharply at Ronove, and he laughed foolishly and disappeared, as if running away..."
Lucifer,"""......Hmph. How could I, the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, be called on for this level of work! ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama could easily have told one of the younger sisters, who look like they have so much free time, for something like this. Sheesh...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Why so grumpy, girl? If you're hungry, eat a cookie or something. Why don't I give you the last one? Ihihi!"""
Lucifer,"""......Hummmmm? How thoughtful. Then, shall I take one?"""
,I lightly pushed the snack plate with the last remaining cookie on it over to her.
Lucifer,"""Thank you"""
,"As though coming as a replacement for the period at the end of the sentence, a sharp sound pierced the table..."
,"The nails on three of her fingers had sharply extended, and were stuck...a hair's breadth into the gaps between my fingers on the hand I had used to push the plate."
,"......It had happened in an instant, ...so for a while, I didn't even realize that her fingernails had grown."
,The tips of those sharp nails were like blades with a red manicure.
,......The spaces between the bases of my fingers prickled.
,"......Those razor‐like blades were sticking sharply into the back of my hand, and into the spaces between my fingers..."
,"By those three blades, my carelessly outstretched right hand was not even permitted to shake, and all I could do now was allow a single line of cold sweat to drip down."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Wowee. ...Isn't it about time you cut your nails, babe?"""
Lucifer,"""Lucifer. ......That is my noble name. Honored furniture serving {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory."""
Lucifer,""".........I'm not like my disgraceful and cretinous younger sisters. If you don't show the proper respect, you will regret it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...How would I regret it? I don't have a clue."""
Lucifer,""".........Heheheheheh. Stupid kid. ...Do you really want me to play with you that much? You really can't get me out of your mind?"""
Lucifer,"""I'll thrust my stake deep, deep into you and make you really enjoy being gouged, got it......? Hehehe{0}he{0}heh{0}heheh{0}he{0}hehehhh......!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........You bitch. One day I'll push you down and say that back to you."""
Lucifer,"""Oh, really? I'll be looking forward to that, then? Ehhehe{0}heh{0}heheheh...... ...Ahhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"""
,Rosa eventually regained her calm.
,"The men wanted to hurry her into talking faster, but Kyrie intervened."
,"...If something like she had just mentioned really had happened, ......it was an abominable past that she wouldn't want to remember."
,"After taking several deep breaths with her hand over her chest, it seemed that she had more or less gathered the resolve to talk..."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......How old was I then, I wonder... ...Probably...middle school, or... ...I don't remember well. Anyway, I think I was about that old..."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Which means... Maybe about twenty years ago?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Back then, my grades weren't very good, and Mother was always angry at me. ......I was trying to do my best in my own way, but I couldn't respond to Mother's expectations at all..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Mother was always very strict with Rosa. I sympathized with her at the time."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Hmm. You say that even though you were always talking behind her back."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Would you give it a rest, Eva. So? Where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, Rosa‐san?!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Hideyoshi‐san, you mustn't rush her now. ......It's alright, Rosa‐san. Tell us at your leisure."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........Thank you. ...It was a day when I had been scolded particularly harshly by Mother."""
,"Even though my tutor had promised to keep it a secret, ...apparently, they told Mother all about how I had complained."
,"Mother scolded me horribly, saying that I was a disgrace to the Ushiromiya family."
,"......Of course, I was doing the best I could."
,"But I had none of Krauss nii‐san's dignity, I couldn't get excellent grades like Eva nee‐san, and I had no leadership like Rudolf nii‐san."
,"...I never stood out, didn't particularly excel at anything, and I almost wanted to ask myself why I had even been born into the Ushiromiya family."
,"I didn't know why I had been born.{n}...On that day, I had the experience of my mind going blank for the first time......"
,"For the first time since I was born, ...I realized that in addition to facing or surrendering to my problems, I had the third choice of running away."
,"Even though I say run away, there was no way I could have left Rokkenjima and gone somewhere else."
,"But, anyway, I wanted to run away from the mansion and the way I was at the time."
,"......In a way, it was like running away from home, or maybe a half‐hearted suicide..."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......I wanted to disappear. Or maybe it was that child‐like form of resistance where I tried to make my parents worry by disappearing..."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........I thought childishly that if I went into the center of the forest, I could escape from the Ushiromiya house, or maybe I could get back at them by getting lost and making them worry."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""So then, ......you went into the forest that you'd been told not to go into?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Yes. After reaching the beach, I followed alongside the ocean. ......I didn't have any particular reason, ......but I felt that, if I went around to the opposite side of the island, there might be a place there that no one knew about, which might become a hidden house just for me."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Starting by the beach, it'd be impossible to go all the way around. It becomes a cliff partway, right? There's no way you could pass that way."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Of course. So, I kept going wherever I could, and kept going deeper and deeper in. ......It was a horrible forest without any paths, but that was comforting to me then. ...If I could make it through such a dangerous forest, then it would be that much greater of an escape from the Ushiromiya family, ...which made me feel good."""
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........How shameful. If you were scolded because of your grades, all you had to do was work harder."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""You mustn't say that. Doesn't Rosa have her talent as a designer instead?"""
,"Literally this could be taken as him covering for Rosa, but everyone knew that Rosa's company was not making any profits."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Quit it. Now isn't the time for sarcasm. ......And then you arrived there by coincidence...? ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s...hidden mansion."""
,Rosa nodded weakly......
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""About how far did you walk. Could you show it to us on a map...? Natsuhi‐san, is there a map of this island?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""No, not right here and now..."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""That would be impossible. I was just walking randomly. Even if you showed me a map, I wouldn't know. ......And twenty years have passed since then. I probably couldn't reach it again even if I went into the forest..."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,""".........Hmmmmmm..."""
,Several people let out dejected sighs.
,"It was vividly clear that in their haste, they had thought that some hint related to the witch's epitaph, or maybe even the gold itself, might be resting there in that hidden mansion."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""The only part of Rokkenjima that got made ready for development is the area around the mansion. ...The rest is completely uncultivated, and it would probably take considerable effort to survey the entire island."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""But just knowing that it actually exists is helpful. It would take some money, but if we enlisted an aerial photography company to investigate, or asked the contractors who constructed this mansion about what happened at the time, we could probably find some way to search for it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes. ...There should be more ways to do it now that there isn't a question about whether it exists or not."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Mmhm. It is probably worth investigating right away."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We will do that investigation together as siblings. We won't let you do it alone, Nii‐san."""
,"It wasn't certain that the gold was hidden in that secret mansion, but it seemed that the fireworks between Krauss and Eva had already begun."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Give it a rest for now, you two. ...Rosa, please continue."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""..................Yes."""
,"Blindly, randomly, I kept running, on and on."
,"Suddenly, it felt like I had come across something like an animal trail."
,"I had no idea how far I'd walked, and I was very tired, so by then, I was just naturally taking the easiest path to walk on."
,"As I did, .........suddenly, right before my eyes, a very, very tall fence appeared."
,It was a fence wonderfully adorned in a gothic style.
,"For an instant, I spun around, thinking that I might have returned to the original mansion."
,"Of course, there were fences around the mansion to stop us from entering the forest. But this fence was decorated differently, ......and most of all, it was very tall."
,It probably reached a full two stories up.
,"It was covered with ivy, and created a mysterious, solemn atmosphere..."
,"At the time, ......I believed the legend of the witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}."
,"I had been told that she was frightening, but some of the servants told me that she would sometimes help you if you respected her."
,"......Since I had started to lose confidence in how my life was going, I believed that the only way I could be saved was by receiving her help."
,"So that's what made me think it. ......I believed that this was the fence of the mansion of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest."
,"I thought that if I could meet with {f:5:Beatrice}, she would definitely save me."
,So I thought I would try to go in.
,"But that fence was very, very tall, and it didn't look like I could go over it."
,"So I decided to walk around it.{n}I thought that if I did, I would eventually reach a gate."
,"But it wasn't that easy. The fence had a length to match its height, and no matter how far I went, I didn't reach a corner."
,"It might have been enclosing a very massive area, ...or maybe it just felt that way because my child's legs made it difficult to walk in the forest."
,"Anyway, because I couldn't find a gate for a while, I started to feel sad, as though the witch had rejected me..."
,"As I did, I eventually came upon a large tree, whose twisted root had bent the fence."
,"I might get my clothes dirty, but if I crawled, it looked like I would be able to sneak in..."
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........And that was the hidden mansion?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I don't know whether it was the hidden mansion we've been talking about... Still, at the very least, it wasn't a place that we know of."""
,It wasn't as though I came out into a garden as soon as I passed the fence.{n}I had to continue through a lot more uncultivated forest after that.
,And then......the forest suddenly opened up. And what appeared there was an unbelievably............fantastical scene.
,"To think that Rokkenjima, where I had believed no one other than us lived, ...had been hiding such a wonderful mansion..."
,"A beautiful flower garden spanned the front of the mansion.{n}It was a flower garden of a completely different design from the rose garden we know so well, and was very lovely."
,"Of course, the mansion was also wonderful."
,"...It was one or two sizes smaller than ours, but it was a very elegant, and yet lovely mansion."
,"Then, ...............I saw her.{n}I saw her sitting in a garden chair, positioned to give a view of the flower garden, wearing an elegant dress."
,It was that black dress embroidered in gold that we would later know from that portrait.
,......I hadn't seen an elegant dress like that except in fairy tales and on the stage of musicals.
,...That a person would be wearing it as their normal clothes... That in itself seemed quite fantastical.
,That magical scene was enough to make me lose my sense of reality.
,"If someone had told me then that it was a dream, I might have nodded obediently, and waited to wake up in my bed..."
,"Since, in my shock, I had forgotten to hide myself, she eventually noticed me."
,"At first, her expression was quite listless, but when she noticed me, her eyes opened very wide."
,...It was only natural—a guest that she didn't know had suddenly appeared.
,"I automatically bowed my head, feeling that I should greet her and apologize for entering without permission..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............Who are you? A new gardener?"""
,Those were the first words she said to me.{n}...That calmed me down a little bit.{n}Because I realized that she could be talked with.
,"Because I hadn't been turned into a frog just by meeting her eyes, like the terrifying witch in that fairy tale."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......I, ......I'm sorry. ...I shouldn't have entered the garden without permission..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................ ......Who are you? Name yourself."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I, ...I am Ushiromiya Rosa."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Ushiromiya. .....................Hoh. ...So you are one of Kinzo's family."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Huh? Ah, ...yes! I'm Kinzo's daughter. G‐good afternoon...!"""
,"I was just a little surprised.{n}...After all, Father was a great man feared by everyone."
,And she had referred to him without using honorifics.{n}So she quickly became frightening.
,"...After all, if she could refer to my fearsome father that way, she must be a witch with incredible power."
,"After staring at me curiously, she beckoned me to come over to her."
,"And I obeyed, although filled with belated trepidation.{n}......After all, I thought I really might be turned into a frog."
,"...And the closer and closer I got, the stronger that fear became."
,"After all, ...I said it several times already, but, ............that woman and her dress and the flower garden and the mansion, ......that entire harmony was so fantastical and beautiful that it seemed separate from reality."
,It surely wouldn't have surprised me even if she was actually a witch...
,And I was truly lucky.{n}She didn't turn me into a frog.
,"As I awkwardly stood there stock still, she motioned to an open chair, and urged me to sit down."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Sit. Welcoming and speaking to those who visit this garden for the first time is my only pleasure. .........That said, I have nothing else to find pleasure in."""
,"As she said that, she showed an unhappy smile for just an instant."
,"Because I was full of a strange mix of tension and excitement, I rudely asked her a question suddenly."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Umm, ............are you the witch of the forest, ...{f:5:Beatrice}......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. I am {f:5:Beatrice}."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""As I thought. {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Did she look just like the portrait?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Yes. Exactly like the portrait."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""So she wasn't just......a witch from Father's imagination..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And then, what did you talk with her about?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...As she prepared some tea, she asked me various things about myself. ......First, she was surprised that I had come through the forest. It seems she believed that many dangerous wolves lived outside the fence."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...So when I told her I had reached this place by going through the forest, she was very surprised. She asked how I had managed to escape from the wolves—did I give them biscuits and they let me go? Or did I cover myself in a magic cloak, or... Those kinds of things, I think."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahahaha. ...That sure sounds like a witch. What an interestin' person."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Quiet, honey. ............It was a long time ago, but didn't Father threaten us, saying that wolves lived in the forest, so we shouldn't get close to there?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Yes, there was a time like that. Ridiculous. Even though Japanese wolves went extinct long ago. What a childish trick."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I don't remember, though...? Did Dad really tell us something like that...? It was the witch of the forest, right? I don't think I've ever heard about wolves."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You were still in elementary school. Don't you remember?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You actually went and replied that you'd want to try petting the wolves. So Father immediately gave up the wolf story and changed it to the story about the witch. Such obvious lies, ahahahahaha."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hahahaha. At the time, the witch story had a much more immediate effect on you, Rudolf, than the wolves. I remember it well. Don't you remember those nights when you clung to my back?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...*giggle*. I see, even Rudolf‐san used to have that cute period."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Oh, put a lid on it. I was just a kid."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Well, anyway. If Father was the one who shut {f:5:Beatrice} up in there, it makes sense that he would use the same wolf story. To him, the vast forest of Rokkenjima was a wall that shouldn't be crossed, dividing his two incompatible worlds: the Ushiromiya family and his mistress's mansion."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""If you think about the height of that fence, it does seem that Father had turned the whole area, garden and all, into a giant jail cell. ......Just like a national border dividing his two separate worlds."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Forget the wolves, were there any kinds of stray dogs there at the time? It could have been a fence to protect against those."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""There are no wolves or stray dogs on Rokkenjima. Just as Nii‐san and Kyrie‐san are saying, that fence was probably a border between us and {f:5:Beatrice}."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""However, if she innocently believed the story about the wolves, that's pretty...naive. That's nothin' like the way I'd imagine a witch."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......That's right. I also sensed that. ...She was very pompous, just like my image of a witch, ...but she was somehow very childish, and......how should I say it, too honest? ......She gave me the impression that she didn't know anything about the world."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""If I had to describe it, ...it was almost as though she had come from a fairy‐tale land. ......She was a truly mysterious person."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......What happened after that? ...Did you end up talking about Dad at all?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Yes. Once every few days, sometimes on an arranged day and sometimes suddenly, Father would appear casually, and they would drink tea together, or take a walk together or something, she said. And that, by coincidence, she was by herself on the day I visited."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I see. Truly a mistress, then. ...My, my. I don't know how much younger she was, but... not bad, Father."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......I remain firmly convinced that it was not an indecent relationship."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Gosh, you are an idiot. There's no way a lover's meeting between a man and a woman wouldn't have {i:some} sensuality. What happened next? What did you talk about after that?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........Because I had introduced myself, I then asked her about herself."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...When I did, the atmosphere quickly grew depressing. ......How should I say it, she seemed very listless and lonely. ...It was the same expression as the one I had first seen on her face."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Well, that's because she was his hidden mistress. If she just walked around wherever she liked, she might have been discovered by Mother. ......I'm sure the situation was almost like house arrest."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Even though she had beautiful clothes, a beautiful mansion, and a garden, she must have felt very constrained. No surprise she felt it hard. .........And then?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""There was definitely something on her mind. ......I remember getting the impression that it wasn't something that I could resolve just by talking to her, and feeling very sad about it as well."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........She seemed to have forgotten that I was even there. ...She was gazing vaguely off into the distance, and was silent for a long, long time."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...I thought that I must have said something wrong, ......but it didn't seem to be the type of atmosphere where I could offer words of apology... ......So, I too remained silent for a long, long time, until she remembered that I was there..."""
,"When she did, ......she muttered unexpectedly."
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Are there really no wolves beyond the fence?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Hmm? Y‐yes. I've never seen wolves even in a zoo."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What is this ""zoo""?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Ah, ...it's a place where they keep all kinds of animals. They're full of rare animals like elephants and giraffes and pandas."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".............................. ...Are there no wolves in a zoo? Then, umm, ...that might not be scary."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Even if there were wolves, all of the animals are put in cages, so it's safe. So you can feel safe as you look at and learn about them."""
,"The witch of the forest, of all people, was for some reason scared of and didn't like wolves."
,I remember it looked pretty comical.
{f:5:Beatrice},""".................. ...How does that differ from myself?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""............Huh?"""
,She didn't even know about zoos.
,"I explained how fun zoos could be, but it was very difficult to get a person like her, who had never been to one, to understand..."
,"Quite the opposite, as I explained it to her, her expression grew increasingly dismal."
,...She couldn't see the difference.
,"It seemed that, although this mansion surrounded by a high fence appeared at a glance to afford her a completely provided‐for life of comfort, she couldn't see how she was different from the animals shut up in cages..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Who am I? ......Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}. ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......But that is not me. I cannot use any magic. ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""..................?"""
,"There was definitely something mysterious about her. It wasn't just that she was somehow at odds with the world, but it seemed that she truly believed that a thing called magic actually exists."
,"I think she talked about various weird things, but I don't remember the details."
,All I thought was: ......this might be a pitiful person.
,"She was unable to leave this mansion of her own will, a prisoner without even realizing it."
,"......And she didn't know anything about the outside world, didn't even understand who she was."
,......She probably vaguely understood herself that she was pitiful.
,"But since she didn't know anything, it seemed that she couldn't realize that this was unhappiness."
,"Nee‐san, long ago, when I told you that I felt sorry for a bird in a cage, I remember you said this to me."
,"""A bird that only knows the inside of a cage doesn't long for the outside""."
,"But she wasn't a bird.{n}She was, ultimately, a human."
,"Even if she had never been outside the cage, she understood that it wasn't the whole world."
,"So, .........I invited her."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Do you want to try......going outside the fence?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Th‐there really aren't any wolves?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""There aren't. You'll definitely be safe."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".............................. ......I want to leave. But the gate is always closed."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""There's the place I came in through. There's a crack you can slip through."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......If we go through there, is there a world outside?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Yes."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................There really aren't any wolves?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""*giggle*. No, none at all."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".............................."""
,"I had only planned to invite her for a short walk, ...but she kept looking over her shoulder at the mansion, as though she were seriously deliberating over something."
,Then I learned what she was preparing herself for.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...............I...have had enough of this place. ......I want to go...outside. And I want to know...who I am, what's happening in this world, ...and the purpose for which I was born."""
,I didn't know what her life had been like until then.
,It was probably something that she couldn't express easily.
,"If it was harsh, she just had to say that she wanted to escape.{n}If it was sweet, she just had to say that she would stay."
,"To liken it to something, perhaps it was similar to how a hot fireplace on a winter day makes the air get thicker and thicker, giving you a headache...?"
,"Even though you know that you shouldn't keep things the way they are, you still need the courage to open the window and be tormented by the cold wind..."
,She was starting to realize that she couldn't stay there forever.
,She was starting to realize that she had to go outside sometime.
,"But, since she didn't know about the outside world, to take that first step outside must have required an unimaginable amount of courage..."
,"And she had taken that into consideration, and resolved herself."
,"She had put that resolution to go outside into words, for what was surely the first time in her entire life."
,...I hesitated slightly.{n}It had been decided that she would live here by Father.{n}It was as if she were Father's beloved bird in a cage.
,"If I just let her escape, ......wouldn't I be harshly scolded by Father...?"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I want to see."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".........Hm? See what?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I want to see...a zoo."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,""".....................ah."""
,I was just a little surprised when she finally showed me a very soft smile.
,"That might have been...an inner peace, coming from her newfound readiness to venture out from her cage."
,A soft smile which I wouldn't have imagined could have come out of that dark face...
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......When I speak with you, I keep hearing about things I don't know. ...I don't know about this thing called school, nor about zoos. I don't know about movie theaters. I don't know about amusement parks."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........And I think, from the bottom of my heart, that I want to know about them. ...Will you take me there?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Huh? ......Y‐yes."""
,"...I was nervous about how I would do it and keep it a secret from Father, ...but her face looked so happy, so I went along with her and nodded."
,But it seemed that the meaning behind my vague expression was not communicated to her.
,It seemed that she believed that I would really take her to all of those places if we left.
,"She was pure and genuine. ......She had probably never been tricked by anyone. No, ......maybe it should be said that she hadn't been taught how to doubt."
,"Her face was somewhat radiant, and yet pathetic.{n}...I wanted to somehow grant her modest wish."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I...have had enough of {f:5:Beatrice}. I want to know who I am. I want to start out as a new human, not {f:5:Beatrice}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, I want you to take me from here. .........I don't need tea anymore. I don't need this dress. I won't meet with Kinzo again. ......Please, take me from here. Rosa."""
,"However, that responsibility was one that a child such as me couldn't possibly bear fully."
,"But her serious gaze and her brilliant smile, ...almost as though an evil spirit had lifted from her, ......made me feel a little courage start to rise up inside myself."
,This was definitely something that would get me in a lot of trouble.{n}......But it was definitely the right thing to do.
,"I don't know how it will turn out, but...... ......I'll take her out."
,"Of course, I won't be able to ask help from Father, and not Mother either."
,".........Should I talk to Onii‐sama or Onee‐sama?{n}No, what about that reliable Genji‐san, or...that's right, what about Kumasawa‐san, to whom I can always talk when I'm in trouble."
,I'm sure they'll be able to do something.
,"Anyway, for now, I'll take her out of here.{n}Because this is no longer a place where she wishes to be."
,"......And so, I took her to the crack in the fence and led her outside."
,"She was all nervous, checking to make sure there were no wolves around, but after that fear disappeared, she seemed somehow to be having fun even just walking around this dense forest."
,"Every time she found something, she would ask me about it.{n}And they were all really minor things."
,......What's that flower? What's that leaf? And that sound? And that smell?
,It was really like...the inside of that fence had been her entire world.
,"So, to her, who had stepped {i:out} of the world, this was........."
,"......You know, it's strange."
,"In the beginning, when I first saw her, I thought that she was the absolute incarnation of a witch relaxing by a witch's mansion."
,"But now it was different. Or actually, the complete opposite."
,"......She had gone out of a world she had believed to be finite, and was full of joy at realizing for the first time that the world was endless."
,So everything she saw was new.{n}......It was almost as though she was the one who had been thrown into a fairy tale.
,"If she was Alice, then I felt almost like a rabbit holding a watch......"
,"To her, it was probably a really fun walk, filled to the brim with excitement. ...But as for me, the truth was, I was completely bewildered."
,"......After all, I had walked randomly to get there.{n}So there was no way I could have known the way back to the mansion."
,"There were no lights in the forest, and I hadn't brought a flashlight.{n}I realized that it would be terrible if it got dark while we were still like this, and grew impatient."
,"She was too innocent, and apparently, she couldn't understand at all how frightening it would be to face the night inside the forest."
,"But I was the one who had brought her outside.{n}...Somehow, I had to take responsibility, and resolve this situation."
,"So I thought. ......That for now we should just go out to the sea.{n}If we then followed the coast around, eventually we should definitely be able to make it back to the mansion."
,"However, that was much more of a problem than I had imagined.{n}...After all, I didn't have a map or a compass."
,"There was no way I could walk in a straight line through an uncultivated forest, and I had immediately lost my sense of direction."
,"I already had no clue which trail I had come by, and was completely lost..."
,"At this rate, night would definitely fall before I even knew where I was walking."
,But I didn't have the luxury to complain.
,"Because that woman following behind me was so innocent and having so much fun. ...Therefore, for the sake of her smile if nothing else, I absolutely had to guide her out of this forest."
,"Gritting my teeth so that I didn't show her a troubled face, I pushed my way onward through the pathless woods."
,"And, although we had various troubles, we were lucky enough to make it to the sea..."
,"At that time, I still didn't even have a clue where I was on the island, but for the time being, I was just a little reassured, realizing that if I just went around this way, I would surely be able to return to the mansion."
,"Of course, although I said that we reached the sea, we were on the top of a rocky cliff. The beach was far below us."
,"I was tired from walking around the forest for so long, so I thought that even though it was a rocky beach, an open area would probably be much easier to walk in."
,"So I planned to somehow go down the rocky cliff.{n}...It did look pretty dangerous, and I wondered if there was some other way."
,"However, {f:5:Beatrice} agreed with my plan without any doubts."
,"......Even though she was probably older than me, ...she obeyed me truly obediently, almost as though she were some kind of chick who believed I was a mother bird."
,I searched to see if there wasn't some place where I could go down the cliff. ...Then I found a place where the cliff had crumbled into a slope.
,".......It looked a little dangerous, but if I went down on both hands and both legs, like I was crawling, I thought it would probably be okay."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Let's go down here. It'll be dangerous if you aren't careful, but for now, if we go down to the beach and walk along it, I think we can avoid getting lost any more."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mmhm. If you will do that, then let's go. I find this getting lost to be fun also. I'm very happy."""
,.........She really had no sense of danger.{n}There was probably no mistake that she had lived a life without discomfort.
,"Even though she knew it would get dark when night fell, she couldn't imagine how dangerous the inside of a forest could be without a light."
,"Furthermore, it seemed that she couldn't grasp at all how dangerous it might be if she fell from the cliff."
,I warned her once more to be careful.
,I cautiously examined the place where we could go down.{n}...It looked......pretty high up.{n}I think it might have been about ten meters down.
,"If you looked at it from the bottom up, it would probably have looked shorter than the roof of the mansion. But looking from the top, it felt almost like staring down from the Tokyo Tower's observation room."
,But {f:5:Beatrice} still appeared to be completely without fear. ...It felt as though she had never even been taught that high places were dangerous.
,"......No, maybe she truly believed that she was a witch, and that she could fly, so there wasn't anything dangerous."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Please be careful. ...It's pretty...high."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mmhm. I will be careful. I see there's a beach if we go down there. Is there an aquarium there?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""No, there are no aquariums on this island. But I think there are lots of fish in the sea."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I see. So there are fish. Are there, ...umm, whales and dolphins and penguins, like you talked about?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""No, you would have to go to an aquarium for those. ......And there aren't any aquariums unless you leave this island."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Is that so? ......But I look forward to it. What kind of fish are whales?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Umm, ...they're really big fish and...huh, aren't they mammals? And they spit out seawater."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh. Then the dolphins?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Umm, they're really smart fish and...{0}huh...{0}aren't they also mammals? They're really smart and they can be taught tricks and stuff."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hohhoh. Then what about penguins?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Umm, ...huh, weren't they birds...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What's this? Didn't you say that there were fish in aquariums?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Ummm, ummm... Well, um, there isn't only fish, they're full of all kinds of things that live in the ocean."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hohhoh. I am really looking forward to that! .........nn—"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"{a:c:Wa, hyaa.}"
,"She made...some might have described it as a funny, ...rushed and short voice, ...no, probably it was a scream, I think."
,She suddenly made a sound like that.
,"......Her body separated from the cliff, and gently fell down."
,"I immediately thought to say to her.{n}""How many times did I warn you to be careful!"""
,"......It was the thought of a child. It was how a child immediately gets mad when something happens, trying to show that they are not at fault."
,"Of course, I said it too.{n}Are you alright? How many times did I warn you......"
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...............So, ...after she fell from the cliff, ...what happened?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""..........................."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......What happened to her? ...Rosa."""
,"Rosa fell silent. ...Her gaze fell to her feet, ...as though she were seeing through the floor to some disgusting memory..."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""She...died, right......?"""
,Eva's brutal words were the ones that Rosa had most wanted to avoid.
,"And when she was hit with them, ......she screamed in resignation."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Yes, she died!! It was a rocky beach, many sharp and dangerous rocks lay exposed!! Her eyes were still open, the blood kept pouring out... Suddenly a red carpet was spreading out...!"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I spoke to her, shook her!! But she refused to respond, not even a blink, ......no, she wouldn't even close her eyelids!!"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""It was my fault! She was wearing a dress, remember?! Even though I knew that her outfit was difficult to move in, I said that we should go down the cliff!! She was incredibly innocent, so she obeyed what I said without any doubts...!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......How long do you plan on remaining dead? Open your eyes already. Honestly, just turning into a lump of meat without me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I was just flirting with your friend the sexy‐assed chick. ......More importantly, what is all this?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mmm. It is as you see. ......I missed my footing, fell down, {i:and died}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What did you say... .........Even though you appeared as the 19th person, ......you say you died......?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't mess with me, that can't be...! Auntie Rosa was a kid, and she was panicking. It's not like there was a doctor. She probably made a mistake, thinking you were dead, and you probably, umm, ......were in a state of apparent death, or something, but actually alive. Right?!"""
,"It can't be. She's obviously alive.{n}Otherwise, she wouldn't be here in front of me, right...?!"
,"...The kid‐aged Auntie Rosa was shaking {f:5:Beatrice}'s body, crying."
,"I too stared into that face, ...............but her eyes were still open, and it really was a corpse."
,"...I wanted to brush it off with something vague like a state of apparent death, ......but from any angle, there was nothing ""apparent"" about it; ...she really didn't look anything but dead..."
,"{f:5:Beatrice} had fallen upside‐down from a cliff of that height, ......and her head had smashed against the pointed tip of those sharp rocks."
,"............You would die, wouldn't you, ......from that height, ......on those rocks......"
,But I can't accept that...
,"No matter how dead she looks, ......she has to be alive...! And she became this damn irritating witch! That way, all of the inconsistencies fit."
,She'd been confined by Grandfather in a hidden mansion the whole time.
,"And then to avenge herself, she planned out her revenge, ......and would go on to commit a number of atrocious murders!"
,"Auntie Rosa probably just mistakenly thought that she was dead. But she was really alive, and as soon as Auntie Rosa left, she miraculously started breathing again."
,"......And then she somehow lived until today, and would open the curtain on the scene of her revenge."
,"Otherwise, the facts don't fit together!!"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I won't let you trick me so easily. Can you repeat it in red?! That she died for certain!! She has to be alive, right?! It's obvious!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""How does {i:that} look like {i:being alive} to you? {p:1:She's definitely dead}!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".................................mgghhhh..."""
,"My theory that the 19th person was Grandfather's mistress, who was a human {f:5:Beatrice}, broke down."
,"...I thought I had managed to segue from a defensive position into a counterattack, but......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Then, ......who are you? You just died, this very minute! You aren't going to say that you revived yourself with magic, are you?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*. I think that I've already explained it, though."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......The me that is lying over there definitely has my soul, but that body was nothing more than a cage of flesh tying me to the physical world. And that cage of flesh was thus broken. ......Do you understand what that means?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............I don't have a clue anymore. ......Keep having fun with your witch‐girl talk. I'll listen instead of eating a cookie! What the... It's empty. Hey, could I get some more black tea?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*! Ronove. Our guest wants some black tea."""
,"When Beato clapped her hands, Ronove appeared."
,......Butlers sure are convenient.
Ronove,"""A refill, is it? Certainly. How much shall I pour you?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Well, I've got more than enough to go with it. Half will be fine."""
Ronove,"""Filling it to the brim regardless is the English custom."""
,"Even though just enough to wet my throat would have been fine, he filled it to the top with tea."
,"I turned my back to Beato, sipping it in silence..."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Wait... Open your eyes...!! {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"""
,"Rosa shook me, ............no, shook the corpse that had once been me."
,I watched over her from a short distance away.
,"Ah, ...so I fell from there and died........."
,"I believed that was true for a while. ...After that, I saw Rosa spend a long time beside my corpse, then watched her as she ran away."
,"......Eventually, I realized that I was a different individual from that corpse..."
{f:5:Beatrice},""".....................That's right. I am......me. ...So, I have finally been able to escape from Kinzo's restrictions..."""
,"Eventually, I felt the memory returning...{n}The fact that I was an Endless Witch who had lived for one thousand years."
,"And then I remembered that I had been summoned by Kinzo, and for a long time, had been imprisoned by him..."
,"While I had been imprisoned in a cage of flesh, I had completely lost my memory as a witch."
,"However, thanks to Rosa, if you could say that...Thanks to my accidental but fortunate death, I had now finally brought myself together......"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Rosa. You are probably regretting that you brought about my death. But as for me, I could even thank you. *cackle*cackle*...!"""
,"Rosa was already nowhere to be seen. Had she gone to call a doctor, or had she escaped from a scene which had become frightening?"
,...That no longer matters.{n}That soulless shell is no longer worth anything.
,"All that aside, ......how frail I am now.{n}Even this glorious midday sun is agony to me now."
,I destroyed my human form.{n}Then I changed it to several gold butterflies.
,"......Yes, with my magic power as frail as it is now, this form is easier."
,"And to escape even a little from the light of the sun, I rode the wind and lightly passed over the cliff."
,It will probably be somewhat cooler in the forest.
,"Anyway, I'll take some time to recuperate, and regain my original power."
,......As I think of how I will pay Kinzo back for all he has done.
,"Dancing alone through the air, I looked down at the shore one more time."
,"On the rocky shore lay the figure I had once possessed, ......and that I would eventually regain."
,"To regain the form of that physical body I have thrown away, ...it will probably take more than one hundred, two hundred days."
,"...It might require one thousand days, or maybe even more."
,"However, I am the Endless Witch.{n}The Golden Witch who has lived for one thousand years.{n}Waiting any countable number of days is no problem at all."
,"*cackle*cackle*. Oh, Kinzo.{n}You may regret that you are not here now.{n}No longer will you be able to capture me.{n}...*cackle*cackle*!"
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........And then, you changed into gold butterflies, hid in the forest, and waited for your magic power to be restored? Is that what you're saying?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is correct. I take this form to sneer at you, but normally, it is easier magically for me to keep my form as gold butterflies."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't stress yourself and stay in an easy form. I wouldn't mind not hearing your irritating laugh."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*. When I turned into butterflies and slipped into the forest, it was already no longer possible for Kinzo to find me. ......However, Kinzo was not about to stand there doing nothing. Still, he would be unable to immediately prepare a way to catch me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Therefore, he first moved immediately to prevent me from leaving this island, and to keep me from regaining my power."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........My, my. All I can say is that Kinzo's tenacity does defy the imagination. ...It is pretty tough to be loved by someone like that. *cackle*cackle*!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""A way to keep you from leaving after you became butterflies? What, did he put a bug net around the entire forest?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. He did the magical equivalent. .........Did you know? On the sea in front of the harbor floats a reef, on which sits a small shrine of Eastern magic."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Ah, that. It was gone this year, though. It was a small shrine built long ago by a mountaineering ascetic, right?"""
Ronove,"""This island was originally an island of distortions. Magical beings and other beings of similar ilk were attracted to it. ......Milady herself is one of them, I imagine. How about some more tea?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*, please. ......They did harm to humans, and probably left several eerie legends behind them."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That small shrine was built in ancient times by an Eastern mage who heard of them. A long time passed, and that power was lost. By repairing it, Kinzo restored this island's barrier, and once again tied me to this island."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Can Eastern magic work on a Western witch like you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Normally the affinity is poor. However, for the purpose of sealing me there, in a way, it might have been suitable."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If it was Western magic, I would have some knowledge. For any barrier, there would have been some measures I could have taken. But Eastern magic is outside my area of expertise. It was as if I had been given chopsticks instead of a spoon for some soup I was trying to eat."""
Ronove,"""In a space strongly controlled by Eastern magic, Western magic loses much of its power. It would likely have taken her a thousand days to regain her power even under normal circumstances, and now it would take her much, much longer."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......So you're trying to say that it took you twenty years to regain your power, and now you are revived, like this?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Those were horribly long years... I spent many days in the form of gold butterflies, found Kinzo's mansion, and watched over him every day. I lived through those days with no means to enjoy myself except to ponder how I would get back at him."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......What was fortunate for me was that during those twenty years, Kinzo tried to use every magic to find and capture me, and failed in them all."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""A human cannot bring about miracles very many times. Even simply holding me captive for that long had been a miracle far above his place. It would be unthinkable for me to be captured like that multiple times."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Grandfather said something in the previous game. It was something like, magic dwells in probabilistic miracles."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mmhm. While Kinzo searched for a hidden art to capture me again, he ended up at that. ...............Then, he finally worked out the ritual involving the offering of thirteeen sacrifices to revive me again."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Thirteen......sacrifices..."""
Ronove,"""That is the witch's epitaph. It is a poem of sacrifices. ......Six people on the first twilight. Two people on the second twilight. And then five more people on the fourth through eighth twilights. A forbidden ritual, involving the offering of a total of thirteen people as sacrifices... Those sacrifices are chosen randomly, and the one holding the ritual, Kinzo himself, is not an exception."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You're out of your mind... Are you saying that all of the gruesome murders that occurred on this island were all part of a weird ritual?!!"""
,I was vaguely thinking that this might be a possibility...
,"But I can't just hear that this is the truth from a witch and a demon and say ""Oh, really?"" and accept it!"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""There are eighteen people on Rokkenjima. Thirteen are sacrificed; only five are left alive. Then I revive."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......In other words, the odds that Kinzo will be able to meet me again are probably around one third. He bet his own life on those odds, wishing for a reunion with me for the last bit of his remaining life."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........You're saying he gathered our family for the sake of that fucked‐up ritual?! Oh, yeah, real fucking funny!! Don't say stuff like that, damn it!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It was according to the contract from the beginning. When Kinzo's life ended, all of the gold I had lent him, and all of the assets that Kinzo had created, were to be received by me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Kinzo put me through a nightmareish ordeal, but thinking back on it now, it was an extraordinary period, even amid the past thousand years. After all, the natural enemy of a witch is boredom. To Kinzo, who offered me a chance to run away from that for several decades, yes, considering that among other things, I might have a slight debt to him."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I decided to go along with Kinzo's game. And so, first off, Kinzo returns to me the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring. It is the house revived by my gold, you see."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Then I choose thirteen people arbitrarily as sacrifices. And as that unfolds, you people are thrown into total confusion, and show me various aspects of the fabric of human relationships as you stand against me, which gives me great pleasure. I really do like this game of Kinzo's! *cackle*cackle*."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aaaaaaaaaahh!! I definitely won't believe in that kind of magic story! ......Then who are you?! You fell off a cliff and died, dammit! Your soul slipped out, became butterflies, and went to the forest? That's all a load of bullshit!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But you are here! Who are you?!! Aren't you the 19th person?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is true, I most surely am the 19th person. *cackle*cackle*cackle*! But it's no good, I'm afraid...? It's no goddamn good at all!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima}!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wha, ...............what did you saaaaaaay...... So you're saying......the X of the 18+X doesn't exist?! Are you saying the piece that I took...{0}{nobreak:the X}...{0}doesn't exist?!"""
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku ku... That is what it means. You have my condolences. ...However, Milady, you truly are a fast worker. I thought you would let him flounder around a little more before turning everything over at the end. Well then, Battler‐sama, would some more tea be agreeable to you?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I, I don't want any, damn it!! I don't believe! The culprit can't be one of the 18!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then, what the hell are you, why are you here?!! If the 19th person doesn't exist, then are you saying you're one of the 18 in disguise?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*! For you, although you are reluctant to use it, doubting one of the 18 will serve as a final escape route, much like castling."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........However, for me, the hard part is just beginning. You need only throw away appearances, and you can prepare a culprit freely amid the 18 people! Finding a route through those 18 pieces, in order to checkmate you and force you to accept me, .........will be truly difficult."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Like hell I'd do that!! I won't doubt any of the 18! I don't want to doubt!! Have I really been cornered here again...?! Damn it, damn it damn it!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It looks like my game with you, which has lasted three rounds, is finally entering the endgame, doesn't it? There's nowhere to run anymore, you know? *cackle*cackle*! You don't want to doubt any of those beloved people in the 18, riiight? I can take that burden from you if you want? And yet, why do you refuse me?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""They say you should play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, and the endgame like a machine. I'll corner you from here on. Slowly, carefully, ...surely. Or, on the other hand, would it be better if I pressed you all at once, as would be fitting for you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That should suit you, let's do that. I already have a thorough knowledge of which methods of attack you cannot handle! *cackle*cackle*cackle* hihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"""
