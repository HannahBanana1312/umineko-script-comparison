,"The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating set down her pen, looked at the ceiling, and sighed deeply."
,The desk was covered with a scattered mountain of paper covered with writing.
,"Words were packed onto the pages in a thin, high‐information‐density language that only the great ones could read."
,Each letter of this language carried the same amount of information as several books in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
,These letters filled every inch of this huge pile of paper.
,"......Surely, she had written out every little detail of some world."
{f:5:Featherine},"""............I have written all there is to write. Though to be accurate, more could yet be written."""
,"She stood up, sat down in her favorite rocking chair, and rocked peacefully for a while."
{f:5:Featherine},"""How much must one write before they can say they've written it all? ......That is what has bothered me in all my years of writing. ......The adventures of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can be very interesting as a tale. However, even I still don't know when that adventure stops being an adventure."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""......My old friend, who is now gone...once said that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life is an adventure from beginning to end, so there is never a correct time to set down one's pen. ......I do not agree. I think one must put away the pen at some point. I believe one should write a tale to an appropriate point, then leave the trailing notes and opinions of what follows to the minds of the spectators."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""......In short, the tale must be put inside a cat box at the appropriate time. ......The cat box has been the subject of this long tale, so is it not better to refrain from writing the finale in its entirety, to instead put it in the cat box and leave it there...?"""
,{f:5:Featherine}......spoke to no one inside the empty study.
,"Of course, no one commented on her words."
,"However, {f:5:Featherine} seemed to hear something.{n}She nodded and grinned contentedly."
{f:5:Featherine},"""Yes, I know. I will write a bit further, then lay down my pen. ......Then, it will be time for us to say our goodbyes."""
,"{f:5:Featherine} held up a finger and spun it around, a signal that she wanted to darken the room."
,The lights in the study dimmed......
{f:5:Featherine},"""Would you mind letting me rest for a while? ......During that time, my cat......or rather, my miko will entertain you......"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Owowow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow, you suck! Can't you be less clumsy with that needle?!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Shut up. If you don't want it sewn by hand, I'll use a sewing machine. Clatter‐clatter‐clatter."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""No! No machines! I want you to do it by hand! So please, just a bit more gently......owow!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""It's nothing a little spit can't fix."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Yeep!! Tell me before you start licking me all of a sudden!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I'm going to sew you up with a long, fat needle now. It'll hurt like hell, so you'd better close your eyes. Five, four, three, two—"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""A‐and keep that stuff to yourse{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}elf!! Ah, B‐Bern, d‐don't, don't, aaaa!!"""
,"But despite all this, the two of them truly were close."
,"Though {f:5:Lambdadelta} had been brutally dismembered in the final fight, she had survived."
,"But, unfortunately, she was still dismembered."
,"So, {f:5:Bernkastel} was sewing her arms and head back on with a needle and thread."
,"The left arm, which was still waiting to be reattached, walked around on the bed impatiently with its index and middle fingers."
,"Only the arms were left to do, so it looked like this would be finished soon."
,"Then, Erika returned, slamming the door open."
Furudo Erika,"""I'm home, my master!! I bought some sesame salt!!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""......Why sesame salt? You aren't planning to put it in tea, are you...?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""It's Erika's toy. ......Erika, did you bring your chopsticks?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, my master!! Great detectives have their magnifying glasses! Furudo Erika has her chopsticks."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Are you ready? Pour out that sesame salt and use those chopsticks to separate the sesame seeds from the salt."""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, my master!! Please watch my fantastic chopstick‐wielding skills!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yes, good luck. ......When you're done, make sure you put everything back in the bag."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},""".........Are you still bullying her like that?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""How rude. I'm playing with her. .........Ah, yes, Erika. The mailman just came by with a letter addressed to you."""
Furudo Erika,"""A letter?! I sense a crime calling to me. Don't tell me, I'll guess who sent it!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........The postmark is from Heaven. It's probably from Dlanor or someone. I'm surprised you're still in touch. ......All it takes is the presence of this postmark, and a deduction like this becomes trivial for {f:5:Bernkastel}."""
Furudo Erika,"""Hey!! You can't do that, my master! Van Dine's Rule #9! It's forbidden to have multiple detectives!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Then you'd better get out. So long, Great Detective Erika."""
Furudo Erika,"""Nooooo, my masteeeer!! {f:5:Erika}, Witch of Truth, is here to serve!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""............I still can't tell if you two like each other or hate each other."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Of course we hate each other. You're the only one I love."""
Furudo Erika,"""H‐how could you, my master!! Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}! It looks like there's not enough room for the two of us!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Are you serious? ......Are you challenging the great {f:5:Lambdadelta}?"""
,Erika grinned and grabbed {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s left arm that was walking around the bed.
Furudo Erika,"""Here is Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s arm. And here is the sliced‐open end of her arm."""
,Erika grinned and wiggled her fingers menacingly.
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Wait, ......you aren't thinking........."""
Furudo Erika,"""Let's see if my rival can handle this."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Gyah, gyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}haha, ahh{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, stoppii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}it that tickle{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}es!!"""
,"......She tickled the open end of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s left arm. Apparently, she was extremely ticklish there."
,"Incidentally, the open end of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s arm was cute and fluffy with white cotton candy poking out."
,"Apparently, her body was made out of sweet candy, with a bit of spice thrown in."
,"Put your mind at ease, as there is nothing remotely terrifying about her severed arm."
,"Erika ran around, screaming ""I've defeated Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} all by myself, just like my master!"" {f:5:Lambdadelta} growled and hissed at her. {f:5:Bernkastel} kept on sewing, an exasperated look on her face."
,It was a very peaceful scene...
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""So? What does the letter say?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Is there anything about how Dlanor and the others have been doing?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Gertrude‐san has been promoted to a full Inquisitor or something. Hip hip hooray, I guess. ......Ooh, in addition to her cat, she now has a {ruby:wanyan:meowoof} too."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............What's a meowoof...?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""What, you don't know?! You're so out of touch! They've been all the rage lately! Even I got a female meowoof a few days back. They make awesome konpeitou too!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I'm totally lost, but I'll make sure I stay far away from your homemade food in the future..."""
Furudo Erika,"""Cornelia‐san is.........oooh. She learned that being good at martial arts gives you an edge in the Inquisitor exams, so she's started combat training. Pretty hard to imagine her doing that, right?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Well, there's all kinds of combat training. What's she doing?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Looks like kickboxing and Chinese Kenpo. Could that be Eva's influence?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........Doesn't she look like she'd fight pretty good standing on one leg?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Good point. A certain someone must've toughened her up by making her stand on one leg all the time."""
Furudo Erika,"""It also talks about Will‐san. Ah, that's a surprise! Looks like Will‐san hit it big on the foreign exchange, and he's now living a life of leisure on the income from his real estate investments...! Sounds like he's started playing badminton lately too."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I'll bet he has a hellish coach."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""His butt's probably swollen by now."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""So, what about Dlanor?"""
Furudo Erika,"""As usual, she's stamping things, stamping things, sealing things, approving things, and {i:sometimes} even signing things."""
Furudo Erika,"""She humbly asks me to stir up a crime in her district, since she would get assigned to it personally."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Well, why don't you? Crime sounds fun."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""They do say crimes occur wherever the detective goes."""
Furudo Erika,"""Well, one of these days. If I feel like it, I might drop by to bully her. Oh, and there's also something here about the Chiester Sisters."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........Wait. I don't want to hear it all at once. Let's hold off a bit for dramatic effect. .........Okay, that'll do it."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ah, I finally grew my right arm back! Do the left one now, please!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Let's have some tea first. ......Erika, bring in a can of black tea and the pot of dried plums."""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, my master!"""
,"With this particular journey over and done with, the Voyager witches rested their wings."
,...It was all so that they could leave on a new journey in search of the next fragment.
,"A short break between trips, backdropped by the pleasant scent of black tea......"
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Where are you going this time?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......If you go north, I'm heading south."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Then if you go east, I'm heading west."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I hope we can find another charming tale like this one."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Next time, I hope you aren't playing the villain, Bern."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You think so? Being the bad guy was pretty fun."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""......I wonder...what kind of tale we'll find next."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""And what kind of tale we'll next meet in."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""The sea of fragments is tiny to a pair who love each other."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Children of Paradise."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""The sea of fragments is pretty huge."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Ghost in the Shell."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""We'll meet again. When something else cries."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........Sounds good. Let's do that."""
,"{a:c:""""We will meet again. When something else cries.""""}"
,{a:c: Ahhahahahahahahahahaha......}
,{a:c: The happy voices of the witches faded into the distance.}
,"{a:c: So long, everyone.{n} See you again, when something else cries.}"
