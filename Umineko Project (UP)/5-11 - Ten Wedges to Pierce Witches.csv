Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Father, ...it's Natsuhi. Good morning..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""There's no way he'll wake up if you do it like that! Father, it's Eva! Please wake up! It's an emergency!!"""
,Eva pushed Natsuhi aside and knocked repeatedly with all her strength.
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Qu‐quiet down...!! Don't make such a racket...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Do you really think now is the time to be saying something like that?!?!"""
Furudo Erika,"""............So he isn't picking up the phone, and he isn't responding to knocking either. What a quandary."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...H‐...he might be in a foul mood again... Kinzo‐san sometimes detects omens in the slightest of changes, and gets into a bad mood for reasons only apparent to him..."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Ho......hohoho... Yes, that's true... This isn't something that's started today..."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Does Grandfather really shut himself away in his study that hard?"""
Shannon,"""......Yes. ......It's not uncommon for him to stay in his study for over a month at a time..."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......Privately speaking, ......even though I work here, I sometimes forget that the Master even lives here..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Gohda. That is not the sort of statement I expect to hear from a servant!!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""M‐my apologies, Madam... I am truly sorry......"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Anyway, ...isn't it bad if we can't get in touch with him? I mean, Father might not even know there's crimes goin' on! Right?!"""
Kanon,"""......I, I'm not sure........."""
,"Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled his words..."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...............Who was the last person to see Father...? ......And when?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I‐...it was me. Last night, ......up until moments before all the fuss of Battler‐kun finding the gold, I was reporting the day's events to him in the study."""
Furudo Erika,""".........So around eleven o'clock last night."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......No way around it. Let's open it up."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Wh‐what did you say...?! This is the family head's precious study and research room! No one is permitted to intrude without his permission, no one!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Who here holds the highest rank? Me, remember?! I am the third in rank of the Ushiromiya family! And if someone must be scolded by Father for opening this door, that will be my responsibility as the highest ranked as well. As this is an emergency, I am opening this door. You have a key, right? Open it."""
Kanon,"""I, ......I believe you know this, but the study door cannot be opened with the master keys."""
Shannon,"""Umm, ......the Master recently took away Genji‐sama's key as well. He has both keys on his person now. ......So, umm......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........So, both of the keys that can open this door are inside the study."""
Furudo Erika,"""A locked room! .........<Good>. Things are finally starting to get a little interesting. ......If, inside that room, Kinzo‐san is lying on the bed with his throat cut, that would be pretty neat."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That is incredibly inappropriate, Erika‐san!! A‐......anyway, as you know, this door can only be opened by the keys that Father has."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......That means it's impossible for anyone, even a murderer, to so much as touch Father from outside the room! So I am certain that the head is perfectly fine...!!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That doesn't make it okay not to make sure he's safe, does it? Is it really that important to you not to confirm the safety of the father you respect so much......?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........Th‐......that isn't what I..."""
,"The atmosphere, which had been so agitated a second ago, suddenly went cold......and an eerie feeling filled the room as everyone stared at Natsuhi."
,......They could understand why Natsuhi would protect the study under normal circumstances.
,"It was understood that she probably didn't want to disturb the research of Kinzo, whom she respected, and she was therefore trying to keep the unpleasant relatives away."
,"However, ......this was an emergency. People had been murdered."
,Natsuhi's persistence in keeping things quiet for Kinzo even in a situation like this...was hard to understand from a rational perspective.
Furudo Erika,""".........The evidence suggests that the crimes occurring on this island are most likely a series of murders following the epitaph. ......It's probably reasonable to assume that the crimes will continue."""
Furudo Erika,"""If we reinterpret the epitaph as outlining this series of murders, that means the crimes will continue further, resulting in a total of thirteen lives being taken. .........Do you have any concept of how many victims that would be?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Wait a sec. How many people do you think there are on this island? ......That'd be almost everyone..."""
Furudo Erika,"""Non, non. You have it all wrong. .........To my knowledge, the serial murder resulting in the most deaths in mystery novel history...was ten people in a well‐known work from England, in which everyone including the culprit died. As far as Japanese mysteries go, it's probably that famous novel in which an astrologer served as the detective. Though there were less than ten deaths in that one."""
Furudo Erika,"""......Do you realize? If this continues and thirteen people die, it will lead to the most prestigious and gruesomely spectacular accomplishment in the annals of mystery writing: the completion of a thirteen‐person serial murder case! And if everyone on this island is killed..."""
Furudo Erika,"""......Why, that could give it an even greater number of deaths than the world record for serial murder mysteries and Japan's record added together, making it a historical achievement in the world of serial murder mysteries! ......Well? Did you know that, ladies and gentlemen?"""
Furudo Erika,"""The culprit of this crime......is undertaking an incredible challenge, one that stands to rewrite the record books of mysteries throughout the world and throughout history! ......But I'm sure all of you were well aware of that, weren't you......? Any mystery lover worth her salt will have read the works of the Queen of Crime. And it goes without saying that any Japanese reader has covered the works of the {c:86EF9C:Shin‐Honkaku} genre of mysteries. ......Are you sure you've been reading enough, everyone? *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*........."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............That's no good."""
Furudo Erika,"""Oh.........?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Looks like you haven't read enough yourself."""
Furudo Erika,"""Did I say something wrong...?"""
,"Erika, who had been chatting away happily all by herself up until a second ago, changed her expression into a displeased glare in an instant..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""About Japanese mysteries. ......Prior to Shin‐Honkaku, a writer of the Shin‐Gesaku school wrote a different work that also qualifies."""
Furudo Erika,"""..................... .....................Th‐.........the number of people was the same in both."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""They tie for the record, but if you pay attention to the fact that the Shin‐Gesaku novel asked its readers to search for the culprit, it's a far more fitting example. If you know so much about this, shouldn't your examples have been based on more than simply the number of victims, like perhaps the approaches of each work?"""
Furudo Erika,"""............nn, ...............khh."""
,"Erika glared at Battler with an expression that couldn't be fully described with the word ""shock"", and her arms shook as she stood there, lost for words......"
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ahahahahahahaha, kyaahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!! Oh my god, she's so laaame, this is priceless!!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Well, I mean, who can blame her, right? Shin‐Honkaku is so much more famous where mysteries are concerned. It's easy to overlook that there were murder mysteries among the Shin‐Gesaku novels. Aaahhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haahh!!"""
,"{f:5:Lambdadelta} kept on hitting the table with both hands, overcome with laughter."
,"Even {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had been enduring the humiliation, suddenly snorted and started pounding the table and laughing in the same way."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Pfft, ..........hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah!! This is just too good!! Giihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihiii!! .........Not bad, Battler's piece. Gahihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hya{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"""
Furudo Erika,""".........I'm impressed. ......Battler‐san, ......you must be quite the reader."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Of books? Nah, I'm no reader, not at all."""
Furudo Erika,""".........You liar. ......You're clearly......quite well‐read."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'd never be so arrogant as to say I {i:read}. ......I don't even get through a hundred books a year. Someone like me should think twice before calling themselves a reader......"""
Furudo Erika,"""Y‐......you miserable......piece........."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""A‐......ahem. ...A‐anyway, we can't let this turn into a massive crime like that...!!"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""That's right. At any rate, checking Dad's safety is our first priority right now. But what should we do? He's ignoring the phone and our knocking. The keys are inside. There's nothing we can do. Are we supposed to knock this thick door down? ......That won't be easy."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Father might have been attacked by someone and severely injured, and maybe he's waiting for someone to help him. ......These are extraordinary circumstances. Even Father will understand. And if he has any rebuke, I'd be happy to take responsibility myself."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........B‐but...breaking down the door would be...a‐altogether too rude......"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""What about the windows.........?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Th‐......that's right. The windows. ......Is there a ladder somewhere which can reach up to the third‐floor windows? We should be able to get inside by smashing the glass...!"""
,Erika finally gathered herself together and her tone regained its decisive edge.
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""The third‐story window...? Th‐that would be dangerous......"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""We won't know unless we try. Is there a ladder around here that can reach up to the third floor?"""
Kanon,"""I don't think the ladder in the gardening shed is long enough......"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......Oh, then what about the ladder in the boiler room? I remember using it some time ago when a bird made its nest on top of the rain gutter...! Yes, that would do the trick! Without a doubt!"""
,He must have been extremely happy about thinking of something Kanon hadn't.
,"Looking pleased with himself as though he had won something, he glanced around at everyone."
,"He was probably hoping that Natsuhi would praise him, but she quickly avoided his gaze..."
,"Of course, Kanon had known about that ladder too."
,"......However, in order to protect Kinzo's secret, he had intentionally pretended to have forgotten......"
Shannon,"""But with this weather and the strong winds... Isn't this just too dangerous......?"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""I agree. If one of us gets seriously injured, we won't even be able to go to a hospital until tomorrow...!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......The wind might not be as strong in the courtyard. I think it's at least worth it to take a look."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""I must say, getting up to the third floor will be quite a challenge...! Back when we had to clean away the bird's nest, most of the servants shrank away from the danger. And that's when I, your humble servant, took it upon myself to accomplish the task. Uha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Right, then there's no problem! We've got a ladder tall enough..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And someone who's proven he can use it."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""............Ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, .........huh?"""
,"Because the courtyard was surrounded on all four sides, while the rain was fierce, the winds had almost no effect."
,"Fortunately, the roof jutted out a bit, so even the rain wasn't so bad."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Alright. Let's try standing the ladder up. ......Be careful. Don't hurt yourself."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sure..."""
,"Rudolf and Battler carried the special ladder, which was designed for work on high places."
,Two umbrellas followed the pair.{n}Shannon and Kanon were holding umbrellas and sheltering Rudolf and Battler from the rain.
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""We don't care about getting wet. Go back under the eaves. ......Gohda‐san! Your knees might be acting up, but you can at least hold a ladder down, right?!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Y‐yes, yes, sir...! If only I had enough Hyaluronan, going up a ladder would be no problem at all... ...I am truly sorry..."""
,Gohda rushed up to replace Shannon and Kanon.{n}Kyrie giggled as she watched him.
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Dad, hammer."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Cool. ......Battler, do you like athletics?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Not as much as I love my cool handyman of a dad{p:0:♪}"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""You little brat. .........Sheesh, I guess I need to show this son of mine my good side every once in a while. Battler, Gohda‐san. Hold that ladder down tight. And make sure you're looking up, okay? My hand might slip and you'll have this hammer tumbling down on you."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Don't worry. I'll catch it and smash your head in."""
,"Rudolf put the hammer meant for breaking the window into his pocket. Then, after cracking his knuckles, he started climbing the ladder......"
Shannon,"""Will Rudolf‐sama......be alright......?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""He'll be fine. That guy could be in an action movie. Plus, sports are one of his strong points."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......I wish you'd tell me how my skating prowess is supposed to help me climb ladders... ......{p:0:♪}I am Ina Bauer, always in danger...or whatever."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""{c:86EF9C:He never dies}, so he'll be fine. ......Anyway, we're really lucky that the shutters aren't down. Isn't it standard practice to lower the shutters to Father's study at night?"""
Shannon,"""I‐it is. When we're permitted to enter, we open the shutters in the morning and close them at night."""
Kanon,"""......However, the Master told us that there was no need for the time being, so I think they were left open."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I see. ...............Father will be pretty mad, won't he? ...If his son smashes his window and comes in while he's sleeping."""
Kanon,"""......Well, ...probably......"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It would be wonderful if we didn't have to smash the window, don't you think?"""
Shannon,"""........................"""
,Both Shannon and Kanon...knew that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.
,"Natsuhi had ordered them to interfere as much as possible, ......but now that it had come to this, there was nothing that the two of them could do."
,......They had tried to interfere by pretending that they didn't know about the ladder that could reach up to the third‐floor window...
,"But because of Gohda's showing off, that ladder had been found..."
,Rudolf carefully climbed the ladder.
,......He would reach the third‐floor window very soon.
,"As he did this, ......Shannon and Kanon stared at him, looking uneasy......"
,What would happen after this?
,To the two of them. To Madam. ......To the Master.
,"......Very soon, Rudolf would reach the window."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......So, the barrier around this room is giving way at last."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hahah. The soldiers are scaling the castle walls. Truly, we stand only moments from the fall of the keep. .........I am prepared to be erased at any moment."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""We can't let that happen. You have to remain alive, even if it means crawling through the dirt. ......I'll think about what comes next. Escape from this place for now."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""That is easier said than done. ......Eva and the others are still in position in the hallway and Rudolf is approaching the window. There's no way of retreat through either."""
Ronove,"""In that case, perhaps you could hide under the bed."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Hmph. So I am not even permitted to await the enemy's arrival seated on my throne?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You might have done that while you were still alive. However, you are now a ghost that Natsuhi and I brought to life. Ghosts should do what ghosts do best and hide under the bed or in a closet."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Will something like that really fool them...? ...So it comes to this."""
Gaap,""".........Don't worry. I'll be with you. I'll get you out at the last moment."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""It'll be dangerous for you. Even though you're a demon, you won't get away unscathed if you're burned by the anti‐magic toxin."""
Gaap,"""Don't worry about that. .........Anyway, I need things to get at least that bad before my heart starts pumping."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""How reassuring. ......Very well. I'll hide under the bed."""
Ronove,""".........Milady. Rudolf will reach the window very soon."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Gaap. I've changed my mind. I will guard this place. Hide yourself along with Ronove."""
Ronove,"""What did you say...? This was not the plan. We planned to leave this place to Gaap and have you retreat, Milady."""
,"Even though Ronove should have been used to her fickleness, this surprised him for the first time in a long while."
,"......Though Beato was the powerful queen, she was also an important piece that should not be exposed to danger."
,"Though she was strong, running to the front lines without any plan would not be a praiseworthy move."
Gaap,"""What kind of whim is this...? ....................."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It's just a whim. I'm not so fond of boredom that I could simply sip tea while leaving everything to you...! I've just gotten the urge to jump into the struggle right away...!"""
Gaap,"""........................ ......OK. It is your game. You do what you want. I'll keep a close watch over the first twilight corpses I erased to make sure nothing happens to them."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Sorry for stealing your time to shine."""
Ronove,""".........Are you certain about this, Milady?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You know that I love attention more than my three meals a day. I've done nothing except gobble up Gaap's turn on the stage. Don't pay it any mind...!"""
,......Ronove and Gaap were both silent.{n}The two of them had already noticed.
,"Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who used Furudo Erika as a piece, was a terrifying opponent."
,"......This fight would probably be terrifying as well.{n}Beato couldn't expose Gaap, her friend, to this danger......"
,"Beato bluffed and said that this wasn't the case, but Ronove and Gaap had already figured it out."
,"Therefore, after confirming Beato's resolve one last time and seeing that she was completely firm in her decision, ......they nodded in silence and accepted it."
Gaap,"""OK. ......I'll leave this up to you. I'm rooting for you. .........Take care."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. Feel free to stand back and watch my performance...!"""
Ronove,"""......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will probably start trying to expose Kinzo's absence with a locked‐room argument. ......Fights in a locked room are normally Gaap's area of expertise. ......Queens rule the battlefield because they are best at fighting in wide open areas. ......This won't be an easy fight."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'm fully aware of that. I currently serve Natsuhi. It would not be right for me to delegate her peril to Gaap and callously watch from safety."""
Ronove,"""............Understood. ......I wish you luck in your battle."""
Gaap,"""Be careful... ......If it becomes a complete locked room, we won't be able to come in and help you."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'll laugh at them a bit, and if things get bad, I'll just grab Kinzo and run for it. It'll be easy. With the door and the window, the past and the future to choose from, there are plenty of places to run to. Of course I won't let this become a locked room."""
Gaap,"""......Though you won't see us, we'll be cheering you on from very close by. ......Good luck."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mm."""
,"Gaap and Ronove became a swarm of gold butterflies and disappeared, and Kinzo melted into the darkness beneath the bed."
,"Then, Beato also became a swarm of gold butterflies and melted away inside the study..."
,"After that, all figures and signs of life had disappeared from the study, and it once more regained a silence as though no one had been there from the beginning..."
,"Then, ......Rudolf's outline slipped into view from beyond the window's curtain."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Dad...!! If you're there, answer! Daaad!"""
,"As he yelled, he hit the window."
,His foothold was so uncertain that just hitting the window felt life‐threatening.
,"But of course, this was Rudolf, the show‐off."
,"Deciding that he couldn't show himself up with so many people watching from below, he suppressed the fear from being so high up...and boldly knocked on the window."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Come on, Grandfather... Can't he hear...?"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""I, I wonder... I hope he doesn't drop the hammer..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""How many seconds have passed?"""
Kanon,"""......It's been thirty seconds since he knocked on the window."""
Shannon,"""So, ......he's really going to...sm‐......smash it? Umm, the Master...will be very angry..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""There's one person who's been kind enough to brag about how accepting that anger is her duty, so there's no need to worry. ......Rudolf‐san! That's enough. Do it...!"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sure...! .........Dammit Dad, you better not complain after I smash it."""
,"He hit it several times, and eventually, a fist‐sized hole opened up in the glass."
,"Because of his unstable footing, this took a lot of effort..."
,"Using the end of the hammer skillfully, he brushed aside the now fractured bits of glass and opened the hole further, stuck his hand through it, and unlocked the window."
,"Then, after a hard struggle, he somehow managed to open the window, and his body slipped through into the study."
,"After that, he flopped onto the floor, using his entire body to enjoy the relief of having a ground under him."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,""".........Dad! It's Rudolf. Answer me!"""
,It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.
,A study. A book archive. A place to sleep. And a bathroom and washroom.{n}It was divided into multiple rooms.
,"......Indeed, with all this at your fingertips, it wouldn't be hard to spend your days in this study without ever leaving at all."
,"The bed was empty.{n}There were marks on it which made it seem as though someone had slipped out, but there was no one in sight."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......They do this a lot in ninja movies. ""The bed's still warm! They can't have gotten far!"" Just like that."""
,"Rudolf tried placing his hand on the bed, but he couldn't feel any heat at all."
,Not only was there no heat......it felt completely ice cold.
,And the bed wasn't the only thing that was ice cold.
,"......The air inside the room......and even the presence about it, if that's the right word for it, ...even that felt ice cold."
,"To Rudolf, it felt as though Kinzo had slipped out of this room a long time ago..."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......It's very clean. There are signs it's been lived in. ........................"""
,Wrinkles in the bed. The slight angle of the chair.
,"Here and there, there were many marks that would doubtlessly have been cleaned or fixed up if someone had come in to make the beds."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""As far as I can tell off the top of my head, Dad must have slipped out of bed several hours ago at the latest..."""
,That placed it in the same general time period as the brutal series of murders.
,......It didn't seem possible to say that Kinzo's absence was completely unrelated to the crime.
,"Having reached a dead end for now, Rudolf leaned out of the window, and told Kyrie and the others in the courtyard to come back up since he was going to unlock the door."
,"Then, he pushed the button on the study desk and released the door's auto‐lock."
,"There was a heavy clunking sound, and Natsuhi and the rest dashed in immediately..."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""F‐......Father...... Good morning..."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Sorry, but it isn't Dad. ......I'm the one who opened it."""
Furudo Erika,""".........Was Kinzo‐san there?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Nope. ......There are signs he slipped out of bed, but no way to tell when that was."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to meet him, right...? At around eleven o'clock last night. I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""W‐......well...... B‐but Father is a fickle man... Many times, he has bolted awake in the middle of the night saying that he had a revelation in a dream, and walked around the mansion. Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Nn, ......y‐yes, that sort of thing has happened before... ...As you say, ......he is, erm, a fickle fellow. R‐right, Kumasawa‐san...?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""...Hoh, ...hohoho. That's true... He might have had some sort of strange dream and slipped out of bed... That happens a lot, yes......"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Then where'd he slip off to...?! Isn't there a good chance...Father's been caught up in this crime?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............You see? We should have checked to make sure Father was safe from the beginning, shouldn't we?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...nn....................."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We can't be sure he isn't in this room. Maybe the culprit tied him up and locked him in the closet or something like that."""
Furudo Erika,""".........Just what I was thinking. Let's conduct a search."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Th‐......the head treasures this study... It will not do to have you pawing all over it...!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Oh, that's right. I have an announcement for our guilty party."""
,"When Natsuhi heard this said from right in front of her, her heart froze."
,......But Erika had only just happened to be standing right in front of Natsuhi when she said it. She had directed her words to the room at large.
,......She hadn't been speaking to Natsuhi in particular.........
,"Natsuhi turned her back on Erika, trying to make it so that her faltering expression wasn't noticed..."
Furudo Erika,"""......My memory is photographic in every detail. If any attempt is made to hide evidence or alter the scene, I will know at once. ......Please don't commit some stupid blunder here and disappoint me. Don't you agree that any whodunit in which the culprit is unmasked by way of some silly mistake or slip of the tongue is dreadfully third‐rate?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""............I, ...I don't understand what you're talking about, but I'll ask you to refrain from imprudent remarks. ......Father, are you there...?! Please answer me...!"""
,"Natsuhi started walking around and calling out in a loud voice, refusing to let Erika say any more."
,There was a knock. Kyrie and the others who had gone down to the courtyard had returned.
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""No sign of Father, I assume?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""He might be tied up and shut away somewhere around here. We were just about to start searching for him."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............I'm amazed he can keep himself locked up in a place like this for so long."""
Shannon,"""..........................."""
Kanon,"""......Give it up, Nee‐san. ......We can't change anything now."""
Shannon,"""I wonder......what Madam plans to do......"""
Kanon,"""......Get paid back for all the lies she's told up until now."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,""".........Shh. ...Let's leave fate in God's hands."""
Shannon,"""Y‐.........yes......"""
Kanon,""".................."""
,"Many people traipsed around Kinzo's vast study, looking here and there."
,Inside the closet and in the bathtub.{n}Even in the refrigerator and under the study desk.
,"......They looked everywhere, almost as though they were ""it"" in a game of hide‐and‐seek."
,"......However, not only were they unable to spot Kinzo, they couldn't even find a single suspicious mark..."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I‐it seems clear that Father isn't here. ......That's enough. I ask you all not to disturb Father's precious study any further."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Yes, yes... There's nothing the Master hates more than having things moved around without his permission..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Father's nowhere to be found. .........Maybe he really was caught up in the crime...?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........Th‐though we can't be sure of that..."""
,Natsuhi averted her gaze once more.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......It's alright, Natsuhi."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......We truly do have our backs against the wall... On the off‐chance that someone entered the study, I had planned to talk my way out of it by saying that he had probably gone for a walk somewhere. ......However..."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmph. No one would believe that I was enjoying a casual midnight stroll in a mansion where a murder has occurred and many people have been killed. Though I wouldn't put it past myself to do such a thing."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Come now, Kinzo. Be a good boy and stay hidden under the bed. ......It's alright, Natsuhi. Remain calm. .........You can prove that someone exists, but you can't prove that they don't exist."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In other words, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world is one in which regardless of whether something exists or not, you can make it ""exist"". ......And the shadows in which you can make it ""exist"" form the world of us witches and the world of demons and devils."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......You mean...the Devil's Proof."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. .........So don't worry. The power of demons will most certainly protect you."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........If it could protect the honor of Father and my husband, ...I would gladly sacrifice this body of mine to demons."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Your resolve is good. ......Don't be anxious. I won't allow them to {i:kill Kinzo}."""
,"At that moment, a dry sound suddenly rang out twice."
,"Erika had clapped her hands, seeking everyone's attention."
,"Though such an action should have been above a guest's place, for some reason, it already felt like a natural right of hers."
,"......After all, she was the ""detective""."
Furudo Erika,""".........I think that's enough. Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san is nowhere to be found in this study."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Yeah, we've searched every possible hiding spot. Dad's nowhere to be seen."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And we haven't found anything out of place."""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, we didn't find anything at all."""
,Erika said it again.{n}They hadn't been able to discover anything......
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""In that case, we mustn't continue to loiter in this room. Do you understand how angry Father would be if he learned that so many people were looking through his study...?!"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Eva‐san, you said that you were prepared to take responsibility, didn't you? I hope you're prepared to be disowned for life...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Th‐that's for Father to decide...!! Not you!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Quiet down. .........I'd like to assemble the facts as we know them. At eleven o'clock last night, the last person to meet Kinzo‐san in this room was Natsuhi‐san, correct? Can anyone confirm that?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Confirm...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, that's right. After all, the only one who claims that Natsuhi‐san really did stop by here at eleven o'clock last night is Natsuhi‐san herself. A confirmation from Kinzo‐san that Natsuhi‐san did indeed come here last night would have sufficed, but his absence is the very issue under question."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,""".........Alibis are the foundation of a mystery, correct?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, that's right. Alibis are important. Of course, they're almost useless when it comes to the actual theory‐making, but it's common courtesy to be particular about this kind of thing."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh. ......You didn't ask for alibis regarding last night's murders, but you'll do it for Grandfather's disappearance, huh? ...You really are unpredictable."""
Furudo Erika,"""Oh, don't worry. Regarding the murders of the first twilight, have no fear that I will fully examine everyone's alibi for that as well later."""
Furudo Erika,""".........So, can anyone confirm that Natsuhi‐san visited here at eleven o'clock? If no one can, we'll be forced to doubt whether Natsuhi‐san really was the last person to spot him."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......A‐are you saying that I can't be trusted?"""
Furudo Erika,"""No, no, just the opposite. I hope that you aren't the culprit. After all, that would be {i:dreadfully} dull, don't you agree? Only the worst third‐rate mysteries have the most suspicious person as the culprit."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""...Natsuhi‐san......is suspicious? W‐wait a second. What exactly is your argument...?!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Yes...! Calling Madam suspicious is the height of discourtesy...!!"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Quiet!! Doctor Nanjo, Gohda, thank you. ......Erika‐san. ......I presume you have some basis for the tremendous disrespect you just showed me......?"""
Furudo Erika,"""......I do. It's painfully simple, but if you'll permit me some TV drama‐quality evidence, I'll be happy to oblige."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............Let's hear it."""
,"When Battler glared at her, ......a cold expression rose to Erika's face for an instant."
,"But it was only for an instant.{n}After smiling peacefully and gazing around at everyone, she started to talk."
,"She looked just like the main character in a play, who had come out onto center stage bathed in a spotlight..."
Furudo Erika,"""Think back to this morning. Please recall the chaos that followed the murders. ......We wanted to inform Kinzo‐san about the crime, but he wouldn't come out no matter how many times he was called on the telephone. Remember what happened then."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Anyway, ...isn't it bad if we can't get in touch with him? I mean, Father might not even know there's crimes goin' on! Right?!"""
Kanon,"""......I, I'm not sure........."""
,"Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled his words..."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............Who was the last person to see Father...? ......And when?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I‐...it was me. Last night, ............up until moments before all the fuss of Battler‐kun finding the gold, I was reporting the day's events to him in the study."""
Furudo Erika,""".........So around eleven o'clock last night. ...........................Heheh."""
,Erika chuckled significantly.
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""A‐and what's your point? Ridiculous."""
Furudo Erika,"""I think Kyrie‐san probably did that intentionally. ......Am I right?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""..........................."""
Shannon,"""Wh‐...what do you mean......by that......?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I figured someone might fall for it."""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes. Thank you, Kyrie‐san. Actually, I was planning to say the same thing, if you hadn't done it first."""
Kanon,"""......W‐...was the question of who saw the Master last...really that important...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes. If we take the circumstances into account, then in response to the question ""Who saw him last?"", it was very odd for Natsuhi‐san to instantly answer ""me""."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Wh‐......why?! Madam told the plain, unvarnished truth...!"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Quiet!! Why do you think that was odd...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Why are you so sure that no one else saw Kinzo‐san after eleven o'clock?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""W‐......well, ...that's because I watched as he went to bed. It's only natural to assume that he would then sleep until morning, and not entertain any other visitors..."""
Furudo Erika,"""Considering the circumstances, whoever saw him last was going to be at risk of being suspected of having some kind of involvement with this case. ......A normal person in your position, Natsuhi‐san, wouldn't say, ""I was the last to see him. I met with him at eleven o'clock."" Right, Kyrie‐san......?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""..................... ......Yes, that's right. ......A normal person would say, ""I saw him at eleven o'clock. But I don't know if I was the last person to see him."" ......Something like that."""
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>. .........Identifying oneself as the final witness is usually quite difficult. ......That is, unless you know some reason that makes you certain that there couldn't have been any other witnesses after you."""
Furudo Erika,"""......In third‐rate mysteries, the final witness is often the culprit. They killed the victim themselves, so they knew that no one else could have met the victim later on...is how the argument goes."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohoh, ...hohohoho... That's nothing more than a minor misuse of words... It's nothing to make such a fuss of and focus on..."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Yes, yes, that's nothing more than nitpicking... Aren't you jumping the gun a little, suspecting Natsuhi‐san because of a little slip of the tongue like that......?"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""And you mentioned that Madam must have a reason to be sure that no one else could have seen the Master, but, of course, Madam has one...! She left the room after seeing the Master go to bed! Following common sense, it's perfectly natural to assume that he probably wouldn't meet anyone else until the next morning...!"""
Furudo Erika,"""......No. That isn't natural whatsoever. After all, Natsuhi‐san, Doctor Nanjo, and Kumasawa‐san all made this claim a short while ago. Please, try to remember."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to meet him, right...? At around eleven o'clock last night. I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""W‐......well...... B‐but Father is a fickle man... Many times, he has bolted awake in the middle of the night saying that he had a revelation in a dream, and walked around the mansion. Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Nn, ......y‐yes, that sort of thing has happened before... ...As you say, ......he is, erm, a fickle fellow. R‐right, Kumasawa‐san...?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""...Hoh, ...hohoho. That's true... He might have had some sort of strange dream and slipped out of bed... That happens a lot, yes......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Yeah. ......Grandfather often slips out of bed all of a sudden late at night... ......That's what you claimed."""
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>. Battler‐san, you have quite an impressive memory. .........In other words, it's well known amongst the people at the Ushiromiya head house, Natsuhi‐san included, that there's a chance Kinzo‐san might wake up in the middle of any given night on a whim and wander around. On top of that, they were aware that this happened quite often."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Isn't that odd? ...If you knew that Father often wanders around at night, there's no way you could be certain that he'd stay in his bed until morning. Right?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It really is......like a third‐rate mystery. A lot of those have this part in the last five minutes where the culprit asks ""When did you figure out it was me?"" and the detective answers..."""
Furudo Erika,"""It is, isn't it? ......That's why I feel let down. If it turns out that Natsuhi‐san really is the culprit, this will be worse than a TV mystery. ......That's why I want to clear away the suspicion surrounding Natsuhi‐san as soon as I can. I want to make sure that this mystery isn't third‐rate before I do anything else."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........ugh......gah......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......There's no need to get anxious, Natsuhi. She is merely playing with words, a favorite trick of would‐be detectives. ......Is it of any consequence? How can she possibly use that one statement to corner you? In the court of hell, all of the demon jurors will declare you innocent. So calm down and don't get flustered..."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Sure, when you say it like that, it does make Aunt Natsuhi look suspicious. ......But to me, it just sounds like you're picking holes in whatever she's saying for the sake of it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But it is suspicious. ......I think this is more than enough reason to suspect that Natsuhi nee‐san might be hiding something..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Th‐that accusation is entirely false...! And you are not being fair, Eva‐san...!! You {i:yourself} can testify that I was in fact here at eleven o'clock...!"""
Furudo Erika,""".........Is this true, Eva‐san?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""........................ .........Oh, now that you mention it, perhaps it is. ......Heheheh, I'm sorry. At the time, I was losing my head because the gold had just been found, so I forgot all about meeting Natsuhi nee‐san until just a second ago."""
Furudo Erika,"""So, Eva‐san, you can confirm that Natsuhi‐san was a witness at eleven o'clock?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Unfortunately, yes, I can attest to part of Natsuhi nee‐san's story. ......But only the part that she came out of this room."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........Wh‐what are you implying?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Let me tell you what I'm implying. ......No, I've wanted to say this for a long time now. ...I really did feel like saying this in the middle of such a tragic murder case would be improper, but the timing now is just too perfect. .........You know what I'm talking about, don't you? ......Natsuhi nee‐san.........?"""
,The servants gulped and held their breaths...{n}It seemed that they hadn't been able to hide it......after all.........
,"In the middle of this heavy silence, ......Eva fingered her trump card, and Natsuhi pretended to be calm."
,Both space and time grew as heavy as lead...and swallowed up everything...
Furudo Erika,"""How long has Kinzo‐san been gone......?"""
,"Erika's words, spoken almost casually, tore that atmosphere to pieces like shattering glass......"
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Simply put, we haven't seen him once at the family conferences this year or last."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right... We've suspected it since last year. ...Seeing as how my son and the others have just been killed, this may not be the time or place to pursue this. ......But there's a chance that this has something to do with the crime, so we will do just that..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It's possible that you have a motive for hiding Father's death. ......We can suspect that you're embezzling Father's assets."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If Father were to die, an investigation would be conducted for the distribution of the assets and your embezzlement would be exposed. That's why you've been hiding the fact that Father is already dead!!"""
Furudo Erika,""".........I see. That's more than enough for the whydunit. This keeps getting more and more third‐rate. Aaah, ......how boring."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I, ......I don't know what you're talking about...!! You accuse me of hiding the death of the head?! Slander of this nature is...absolutely unforgivable!!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""That's right...!! In addition to Madam, the other servants take care of the Master on a daily basis, and they see him all the time...!! Genji‐san, Shannon‐san, and Kanon‐kun...! Even Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san meet with him often...!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......P‐perhaps because he doesn't trust me, I haven't seen him even once since last year, but..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Be quiet, Gohda!!!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Eek!! M‐my apologies...!"""
Furudo Erika,"""All of the witnesses besides Natsuhi‐san are servants she employs. ......You paid them to corroborate your story... Ohh, this really is third‐rate. What a waste of time. .........I'm disappointed, Natsuhi‐san. I think it's time I concluded this now."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""C‐.........concluded what......?!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Ushiromiya...Kinzo‐san."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........What is it, ...uninvited guest?"""
Furudo Erika,"""You don't exist. ......You're a ghost whose death was concealed by people who didn't want it known due to the inheritance problem."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Hmph. ......Heheheheheheheh."""
Furudo Erika,"""If you're a ghost, you should pass on quickly to the next world as ghosts are meant to. ......Oh, where are my manners, this is the first time we've met and I've yet to give you a proper greeting."""
Furudo Erika,"""......Good day, pleased to meet you. And goodbye!!!"""
,"Beato's pipe......stopped mere millimeters from Erika's face, so close that you might just barely have been able to wedge a single sheet of paper between them."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And good day from me. ......Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden. I shall be your opponent in this fight from here on out."""
Furudo Erika,"""Glad to meet you. I'm the detective of this game, Furudo Erika. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. And soon, to bid you farewell."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, you're Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s next piece after Ange. ......I'm afraid I didn't get to fight with her to my satisfaction in the end. It pleases me that we can test wits at last, piece of Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!"""
Furudo Erika,"""............My master is almighty and all‐powerful. A fool like you couldn't even begin to compare with her. I accept your challenge."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*. You really are calm. ......Even though a witch has appeared before you and is about to fight with magic and fantasy. .........If you were Battler, you'd be on your knees wailing that this isn't a mystery anymore."""
Furudo Erika,"""Well, parallel worlds like this are popular even within the mystery genre these days. Are you familiar with that detective who reasons from an armchair in a meta‐like space?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Mind your anachronisms. That author doesn't make his debut until next year."""
Furudo Erika,"""You certainly are picky for a witch."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hahha!! You think yourself a witch's equal? Don't be so conceited, you miserable little {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!"""
,"Beato snapped her fingers, and something bounced around the room at terrifying speeds...!!"
,It was the witch's stake. The witch's wedge which contained the power of the blue truth within it...!
,"Of course, a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Erika couldn't follow its terrible speed with her eyes."
,"Erika understood this, so she didn't attempt to look every which way stupidly trying to spot it."
Lucifer,"""You slowpoke!! Take this!!"""
,"With a terrible sound, Lucifer's blue stake buried itself into Erika's right collarbone."
,It shot all the way through and out of her back.
,"Spinning as she rebounded off the walls, Lucifer landed in front of Beato, and disappeared, laughing shrilly."
,"Erika wasn't blown back.{n}However, a blue wedge was stuck deeply into her."
Furudo Erika,""".........So this is that so‐called blue truth. Well then, let me hear your opinion."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""{p:2:You can't eliminate the possibility that Natsuhi met with Kinzo at 11 p.m. In the six‐plus hours between then and the time you all barged into the study, Kinzo had every opportunity to escape! Because of this, you can't state decisively that Kinzo doesn't exist}."""
,"Beato announced that with an expression worthy of her title as witch.{n}Erika, on the other hand, was silent."
,......Was she too shocked to speak?
,There was no anguish in her expression.{n}She was just quietly listening to Beato's blue truth.
,"No, ......judging by her disdainful expression, it would probably be more appropriate to say that Beato's words went in one ear and out the other."
Furudo Erika,""".........<Good>. Begin with the orthodox. .........By the way, this thing really is stuck good. It won't come out."""
,"She tried pulling from the front and the back of the blue wedge that pierced her, but it didn't budge an inch."
,"However, her indifferent, relaxed expression didn't budge an inch either."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You can't take it out! ......The blue truth can only be broken by the red truth. ......And as you are a guest who came to this island a day ago at most, there exists no truth that you could possibly know! There is no red available to the likes of you...! In other words, this is checkmate!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""......I see. This is one of those spaces. ......In that case, I'll need a piece suitable for fighting a witch. ......I am the detective. Let it be my role to deal with the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit. You are a witch. ...There is a piece better suited to the role of dealing with witches and demons."""
Furudo Erika,"""Allow me to introduce you. .........Miss Dlanor. It looks like it's your turn."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""D‐.........Dlanor...!!!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ahhahahahahahaha!! I knew it, I was certain you'd bring that piece in sooner or later...!! The ten witch‐hunting wedges, the archbishop of witch hunting, Dlanor!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""There's no more fitting piece for a battle against devils and demons. I have my double, Erika, and the greatest natural enemy of witches, Dlanor."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I've now taken control of the seventh rank with my two rooks. ......And now you'll entertain me, {f:5:Lambdadelta}. And you too, {f:5:Beatrice}. As I watch you struggle and scramble to no avail. ......*giggle*, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"""
,"The air shone brightly, and the piece Erika had guided there showed its form..."
,"It was a form that resembled a cleric, perfect for confronting an evil witch......"
Dlanor,"""Pleased to meet {f:5:you}. Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox} is my {f:5:name}."""
,"Even though the atmosphere in this space could be cut with a knife, she introduced herself in a neat and frank manner."
,"......Her out‐of‐place appearance, completely different from those of the demons and witches, felt blatantly odd and had a kind of severity to it."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......This is the first time I've met you, but I've heard all the rumors. Therefore, this truly doesn't feel like a first meeting."""
Dlanor,"""The same goes for {f:5:me}, Miss {f:5:Beatrice}. Eiserne Jungfrau has a detailed file on you 600 pages {f:5:long}. I always look over those, so this doesn't feel like a first meeting to me {f:5:either}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The secretary of hell could summarize those 600 pages in a mere six letters."""
Dlanor,"""Allow me to {f:5:ask}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""‘Danger’."""
Dlanor,"""That's a good {f:5:summary}. When I get back, out of respect to you, I will close out your file with an additional two letters for a total of {f:5:eight}."""
Furudo Erika,"""<Executed>."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........So I'm <cute> now, *cackle*! Flattery will get you nowhere, my guest...!"""
Dlanor,"""Then let us {f:5:continue}. Miss {f:5:Beatrice}. I, Chief Inquisitor Dlanor, do humbly accept my role as your {f:5:opponent}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I've already completed my first move. If you can't remove the blue wedge from that Furudo Erika over there, then you might as well trudge back up to heaven, and get back to your usual boring job of stamping things!"""
Furudo Erika,"""......Take care of this wedge or whatever it is, please. {f:5:Beatrice}‐san seems to think that this is all it takes to achieve checkmate."""
,"After making a show of tapping the blue wedge that pierced her with her finger, Erika shrugged as though taunting {f:5:Beatrice}."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It's alright. I'm just going to toy with her a bit. ............After all, if things get bad, I can take Kinzo's ghost and flee from here whenever I want. I can leave this room at any time and go anywhere."""
Dlanor,"""That is {f:5:useless}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Hoh?"""
Dlanor,"""Encountering me is equivalent to your {f:5:demise}. There will be no {f:5:escape}. No one can evade {f:5:me}."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""As you say, there's always the possibility that Father bolted awake and went off somewhere. .........But you know what? I can state for certain that such a thing couldn't have happened. Heheheh, you know why?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""O‐of course I don't...! Are you saying that you stood outside this door all night, watching to make sure the head didn't take a step outside...?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes, someone was watching. This little guy right here!!"""
Gertrude,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following. Be advised that entering or exiting through this door is impossible. Guards, you are hereby ordered to blockade the study door."""
,"The doors to heaven opened with a strong, unrelenting radiance like the sun's, and Dlanor's subordinates appeared."
,Their words were clad in the red truth and cut off the witch's method of escape.
Chiester410,"""Chiester410, right here!"""
Chiester45,"""Chiester45, right here! It has been some time, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}! We were dispatched in accordance with Alliance Agreement #1516 and a request from the Great Court of Heaven. We apologize for the rudeness that is to follow...!"""

Dlanor,"""Your work is {f:5:appreciated}. .........Miss {f:5:Beatrice}. I have had your paths of retreat {f:5:terminated}. You cannot leave through the door, nor can you leave through the {f:5:windows}. You will find that escape is now {f:5:impossible}."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........You think you have me trapped with this alone? *cackle*cackle*......"""
,The Inquisitor in Heaven and her subordinates surrounded the witch.
,The subordinates used a powerful barrier to cut off Beato's methods of escape.
,"......Demons prefer to fight, and as a result, they sometimes allow their victims to escape."
,"However, angels prefer to block off passages of escape, and as a result, they eradicate their targets without fail...!"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""In other words, from the time you claim you bid him goodnight yesterday...until the time Rudolf opened the door, this study was a perfect locked room...!"""

Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Mm. I would not hesitate to give up this life of mine, but for Natsuhi's sake, I cannot die yet."""
,Beato waved her pipe and the air was split vertically.
,"Then, a pitch black gate appeared there and slowly opened."

Kanon,"""......It's true that there have been always been rumors about hidden passages only the Master knows of..."""

,"Natsuhi let out a cry, but it was too late...{n}She had completely risen to their provocation...!"
,The blue wedge to the foot representing a telephone discussion.
,The blue wedge to the neck representing the study itself being called Kinzo.
,The blue wedge to the gut representing Natsuhi herself being called Kinzo.
,The blue wedge to the thigh representing Natsuhi letting Kinzo escape out of the window and locking it afterwards.
,The four of them shattered with the sound of thin glass...!
,"Because Natsuhi, {i:the one who knew the truth,} had denied them, those denials had gained the power of the red truth...!"
,"Despite Kinzo's absence from this locked room, Beato had introduced five ways that Kinzo could still exist."
,Natsuhi had carelessly destroyed the premises behind four of those herself...!!
,Only one wedge remained.
,"In other words, this was the last blue truth which could bury the contradiction of Kinzo existing in the study at eleven o'clock but not existing there later after it had become a locked room."
,"There was only the theory that pierced Dlanor's chest: ""Kinzo is hiding somewhere in this room""."
,"With this theory, even if Kinzo wasn't present in this locked room of a study, he could ""exist"" here...!"

,"Beato was blown back like a leaf dancing in the wind, knocked around over and over again like an empty can lying on a road."

,"At these words, the final wedge shattered, and at the same time, the pitch‐black gate which was about to open shattered once again."
,"This time, the warp portal had been completely destroyed..."
,No longer would Kinzo be permitted to exist in this room......or escape from it...
,Beato struggled to her feet......but that was the best she could do.{n}She no longer had the energy to fight.
,She had taken all of the denying red head‐on from close range.
,"It was all she could do to withstand the pain, which was so strong it felt like she'd vomit up all her insides..."
,"Even Beato, who had held a monopoly on the title of strongest and most evil witch all this time, ......couldn't do a thing against a witch hunter."

,It just piercingly and coldly surveyed the scene.
,And the expression on his face......was a quiet displeasure. Anger.
,He wasn't feeling compassion for Natsuhi because her lie was about to be exposed.

Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahahahaha!! Natsuhi, {f:5:Beatrice}, stand by and watch! ......We'll show you what it means to be the head of the Ushiromiya family!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...That Battler, what is he trying to prove......?"""
Furudo Erika,"""There's no way he can do anything. ......This is a perfect locked room!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Aunt Natsuhi, come over here. I'll tell you how I want you to move."""
,Battler called Natsuhi over to the window and whispered something to her with his back towards the others...
Furudo Erika,"""......Miss Dlanor, there isn't a remote chance of a mistake, is there? It {i:is} impossible for Kinzo and the witch to slip out of this room, correct?"""
Dlanor,"""Of {f:5:course}. ......Gertrude, Cornelia, and the imperial guard, double check that the seal of this locked room is {f:5:perfect}."""
Gertrude,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following. Our barrier is perfect."""
Cornelia,"""For your attention: there are no hidden doors, and escape will not be granted through the door or the windows! Guards, if Battler breaks through the barrier, fire your arrows without hesitation!"""
Chiester00,"""Ch‐Chiester Troops, roger. Battler‐sama, prepare yourself...!"""
Chiester45,"""Escaping from this room...is impossible...!"""
Chiester410,""".........But he'll do it nyeh."""
Chiester45,"""H‐how...?!"""
Chiester410,"""He's certain he can succeed even without any basis. That's what it means to be the Ushiromiya head nyeh...!"""
Ronove,"""............True. Let's watch."""
Gaap,"""Yeah. ...Let's see the majesty of Riiche's opponent...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then I'll begin."""
,Everyone nodded and watched Battler's every move...
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So I'm Grandfather, and I was lying in bed like this, grunting my understanding of Aunt Natsuhi's report or whatever."""
,Battler laid down on the bed himself.
,"As if it still mattered now, Erika grumbled about disturbing the crime scene, but no one listened to her."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then, I stop answering and fall asleep. .........Well, realistically speaking, I probably get tired of all that talking and only pretend to be asleep."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ahahahaha! You know me too well...!"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I, ......I see that Father has gone to sleep, ...bow silently, and leave."""
,"Natsuhi lowered her head to Battler, who was still lying down in the bed, and turned around..."
,"Then, she started wandering around, as though doing an inspection of the room."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......After seeing Grandfather go to sleep, Aunt Natsuhi apparently performs an inspection of the room before leaving."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Of course, she has Shannon‐chan and the others clean it every day, but she still checks it thoroughly herself. ......Making sure there was no dust piling up. Making sure that he hadn't run out of any consumables."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Y‐yes. This is the family head's treasured room, so I check everything carefully myself instead of relying entirely on the servants. I do this every single time."""
Shannon,""".........Th‐that's true. Madam always checks things very carefully."""
Kanon,"""Her inspection is very detailed, and she even checks all of the consumables in the washroom one by one."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""In other words, it's not just dust on the windowsill like you see all the time on TV. .........She even checks to see that there's enough soap and toilet paper in the washroom. Pretty devoted, if you ask me. It wouldn't kill you to skip a day from time to time."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Th‐that is my routine. I mustn't become complacent in my inspection of the head's room for even a single day."""
Furudo Erika,"""............What is your point? Please don't waste our time putting on airs."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle*. Isn't putting on airs the detective's right?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Nn, gah, ......{i:I}...am the...d‐detective........."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Since we're inside the study, you can probably tell, but even though we call it a study, it wouldn't be wrong to call it a second house inside the mansion."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It has a sleeping room, a study, a washroom, and even a toilet and bath. So it's not so much a ""room""...as it is a ""house""."""
Dlanor,"""......Thank you for the explanation of the study's {f:5:layout}. However, the move of having him hide somewhere within it has already been {f:5:defeated}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""There won't be any hiding. But I'm pretty sure there are plenty of blind spots. ......For example, if Aunt Natsuhi went into the bathroom to check the amount of toilet paper, most of the study would be out of her sight range."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......In other words, for almost every location in the study, the observer would have disappeared."""
Chiester45,"""!! ......O‐observer disappearance...! We've lost track of Kinzo...!"""
Gertrude,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you that the witch's darkness is filling the study."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Good. ......It's being filled with the power of darkness. Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"""
Furudo Erika,"""And so what if the observer...if Natsuhi left...? ......So what?!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""When Grandfather noticed that fussy Aunt Natsuhi finally leaving, he got up."""
Furudo Erika,"""Why?!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahhahhahhahha!! On a night of madness such as this, nothing goes better with a drink than enjoying the mad weather of the night sky!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Because Aunt Natsuhi was in the blind spot of the bathroom, it becomes possible for Grandfather to walk about the study at will."""
,It was possible for him to move without Natsuhi's knowledge.{n}It was possible for him to move without contradicting what Natsuhi knew!
Chiester00,"""Warning! Battler is approaching the study door!"""
Gertrude,"""For your attention: a loud noise is produced when the lock on the study door is released. Know that {p:1:you cannot leave through the door without drawing Natsuhi's suspicion}."""
,"Because Battler had acted as though he was heading for the door, Gertrude, who was sealing the door, immediately issued a warning."
,Maybe it was possible for him to leave the study while in Natsuhi's blind spot.
,......However.
Furudo Erika,"""That's right...the sound!! We know there's a loud sound when the auto‐lock's released! Even if Natsuhi was in a blind spot inside the study, she wouldn't have missed the loud sound of the auto‐lock releasing. There's no {i:way} she wouldn't find that odd...!!"""
Gertrude,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you that {p:1:Natsuhi did not hear the sound of the door opening while in the room}."""
,"The washroom and toilet are very close to the door.{n}Even if they hadn't been, that auto‐lock always lets off such a massive sound."
,She'd be able to hear that sound no matter what.
,"Natsuhi had already spoken with Erika and the others about the details of the previous night, and she had made it quite clear that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred."
,The argument that Natsuhi could have failed to hear the lock would not work...!
Gertrude,"""For your attention: I further inform you of the following. {p:1:Kinzo entering or exiting through the door will not be permitted}."""
Cornelia,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you that this is a useless struggle! It is foolish in the extreme...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........It's true that I can't break through the red of that girl by the door. .........But what about you over there by the window?"""
Cornelia,""".........!"""
,"Turning his back to Gertrude, who claimed that leaving through the door was impossible, Battler locked his gaze on Cornelia, who stood in front of the window."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Make sure you hold that barrier of yours up tight. ......Or else you're gonna be.........{i:sent flying}."""
,"By now, Battler's target was clear. .........It was Cornelia.{n}And......it was the window."
,He was going......to smash this locked room from the window.
,"Not expecting to be chosen as the target herself, Cornelia was overawed for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure."
,"Although it was rare, it happened sometimes that a witch struggling to flee would directly target the one setting up the barriers."
,And it was always the witch's last futile resistance at the brink of death!
Gertrude,"""For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following. Battler's target is you, Cornelia. I ask that you be on your guard."""
Cornelia,"""It is foolish in the extreme! God, have pity on this foolish lamb...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'm no lamb. ......The head of the Ushiromiya family is an eagle. Even if he only has one wing. .........Don't think you can keep me shut up in this study forever with just a flimsy window like that."""
,"......Starting from a low posture, ......both silent and supple, ......Battler ran forward like a white leopard."
Furudo Erika,"""............Th‐......this guy......couldn't possibly mean to.........!!"""
Cornelia,"""............!! Th‐this is...... .........gh. F‐for your attention...! There is no way to defeat my red! Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"""
,"Cornelia thrust out both her arms and drew a sign.{n}When she did, a red barrier blocked the way ahead of Battler."
Cornelia,"""I beg to inform you that this is useless, Ushiromiya Battler...! For your attention: my {p:1:windows are sealed from the inside, and Natsuhi did not help Kinzo to escape}...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:I'm not saying Aunt Natsuhi helped Grandfather escape. ......What if Grandfather snuck out, keeping it a secret from Aunt Natsuhi}?!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Wh‐why would Kinzo go out the window on his own?!!!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""On this night of madness, leaping out into the rainy sky...is but a leisure activity to pair with my drink!!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""But this is the third floor! It's impossible!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Even you must occasionally jump the bottom step when going down a flight of stairs, right? Three stories is nothing for Kinzo...!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""I wouldn't put it past him."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Yes, I wouldn't put it past him."""
Furudo Erika,"""Th‐that's...r‐ridiculous......!!!"""
,"Blue cracks appeared in Cornelia's red barrier, and it shattered with a crisp sound."
,It was all far too quick.
,It looked almost as though she'd gotten out of the way herself in fear of Battler.
Chiester45,"""E‐...{ruby:99.9999999...:endless nine}...!! Magic resistance, {ruby:99.9999999...:endless nine}!!"""
Chiester00,"""Cornelia‐sama, you can't block it, retreat...!"""
,"At the same time the barrier shattered, the window behind Cornelia's back was flung open."
,The curtains fluttered for just an instant.
,"Though it was all filled with rain, the heavens and the courtyard were spread out in front of them...{n}A fitting exit for an eagle leaping from this locked room!"
Dlanor,"""Cornelia, reapply the {f:5:barrier}!!"""
Cornelia,"""As you wish, Supervisor Dlanor! Kn‐know that you will not succeed in breaching this window...!!"""
,Cornelia quickly came back to her senses and set up another red barrier.
,"......However, this was the last one."
Cornelia,"""For your attention: I beg to state the following...!! Let us temporarily assume that Kinzo did escape through the window...! In that case, how did he lock a window which cannot be locked from the outside?! {p:1:The window was locked from the inside}!!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........No good!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, it's no goddamn good at all!!"""
,Kinzo and Battler grinned!
,"She thought this feeble red could block the charge of Battler and Kinzo, the two family heads?"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:After Grandfather jumped out the window, Aunt Natsuhi probably noticed a slight draft. She then approached the window, realized that it was wide open, and quickly closed and locked it}...!!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""{p:2:Natsuhi probably couldn't even imagine that I had slipped out the window}!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:Yeah!! So it's only natural that Aunt Natsuhi thought Grandfather was sleeping in bed}!!"""
,"Now that Battler had found the answer, the red barrier was more fragile than thin glass."
,"The red magical wall of certainty had been smashed again, so easily that it disgraced the name of certainty itself!"
,Could it be believed?
,That barrier was more firm than any shield Ronove had ever used against Jessica.
,And yet it had been......destroyed so easily...!
,"Though Battler was charging furiously forward and had almost reached Cornelia, she didn't step aside."
,"Her steel spirit, worthy of the name Eiserne Jungfrau, didn't allow her to step aside."
,"She took a talisman from her pocket, placed it in thin air, and drew a sign."
,"Then, not red, but blue burned there.{n}Though it was far more frail than the red barrier, it was her last method of resistance."
Cornelia,"""Y‐you won't get through, you won't!! For your attention, for your attention!! {p:2:Be that as it may, this is the third floor...! How could a wingless human escape from the window}......?!! Know that you won't get through, you wooooooooon't!!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Just quit your whining and watch!!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:This is the answe{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er{-}r{-}r{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}ra{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh}!!"""
,Battler......flew.
,"He burst through Cornelia's blue barrier, smashing it away, .....and his body flew out the window into the darkness of the rainy sky."
,"The fragments of the blue barrier scattered, leaving blue dust in their wake, coloring the air beautifully."
,The locked room......had been smashed open......!!
,Battler......had jumped from the mansion.
,He was in the sky above the rainy courtyard.
,......All of the raindrops had become small round gems that were scattered through the air.
,Battler was floating through the jewelry‐box world of this beautiful stormy sky filled with countless raindrop gems.
,"In the sky of a world frozen in time, Dlanor and Battler faced each other."
,"If Battler, who had smashed and flown out the window, was like a knight leaping off a white horse, ......then Dlanor, who floated in the air waiting for him, was also a knight."
,"In the air above the courtyard surrounded by the Ushiromiya mansion and frozen in time, ......the true new head of the Ushiromiya family and the disciple of heaven who would test him crossed paths......"
Dlanor,"""......Brilliantly {f:5:done}. Whether you live or die when you fall into the courtyard, it does not change the fact that Kinzo could have broken out of this locked {f:5:room}...!! You are a true martyr, giving up your life to {f:5:jump}...!! You did well to break our locked‐room {f:5:barrier}. I am {f:5:impressed}, Ushiromiya Battler!!"""
Dlanor,"""However, I am Dlanor A. Knox, Chief {f:5:Inquisitor}!! I cannot allow you to escape out from under my {f:5:nose}...! Now, at the end, allow me the honor of crossing swords with {f:5:you}!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Sure, bring it on. ......This game isn't as easy as it looks."""
,In this world where the gems of rain......fell slowly like large snowflakes on a snowy field.
,......Dlanor and Battler slowly.........crossed paths.
,"It seemed slow. And yet, ......it happened in a flash."
,Their gazes crossed and clashed like lightning.
,"When knight confronts knight, it is always head‐on and decided in a single strike......!"
,Blue and red......crossed paths......
Dlanor,"""{p:2:Was the existence of Natsuhi's blind spot within the study depicted {f:5:beforehand}? If it was not, this theory is {f:5:impermissible}}. {p:1:Knox's 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}}...!!"""
,"Dlanor's double strike with both the blue and red blades sliced at Battler, .........and missed."
,"Those longswords, which had never lost in a hundred battles, cut through the empty air......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:1:When we entered the study, its structure was mentioned clearly}. ......Sorry, little miss."""
,"For the first time, Dlanor showed an expression.{n}......It was a soft smile."
,She had known since long ago that the study's structure had been mentioned.
,"But she couldn't let him escape without making a single strike.{n}As an Inquisitor, she could not do that."
,"So though she had known that she wouldn't make it, she had still crossed swords with Battler."
Dlanor,"""Yes, I {f:5:knew}. ......That answer of yours doesn't violate Knox's eighth {f:5:commandment}."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Don't hold this against me. I hope you're ready."""
Dlanor,"""Yes, {f:5:come}."""
,In Battler's hand......was a blade that shone red.{n}That blade etched out the red truth......
,{p:1:― It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.}
,{p:1:― A study. A book archive. A place to sleep. And a bathroom and washroom. It was divided into multiple rooms.}
,That was already presented.
,And it suggests that room‐sized blind spots can exist within the study...
,"Without any mercy, ...no, without any reluctance that would have been dishonorable, ......the sword of red truth cut into Dlanor."
,Its sharp trail cut the countless gemdrops filling the sky into beautiful hemispheres......
Dlanor,"""Brilliant.........{f:5:work}......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................"""
,Time...exploded into life.
,Both of them...fell through the courtyard.
,One drifted down. The other tumbled through the air.
,"Then, there was a soft sound and a dull thud."
,......The first was the sound of Battler landing gently in the courtyard.{n}The second was the sound of Dlanor crashing down.
,"After crouching down for a while, .........Battler slowly stood up."
,"Though he had jumped down from the third floor, ......he had landed as lightly as though he had merely jumped over a fence......"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""B‐...Battleeeeeeeeeeer.........!!"""
,"Beato leaned out of the study window, looking to see if the supposedly wingless Battler had landed safely."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Beato!! Come on, jump!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Huh......?!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That window is our way out! ......So jump!! You aren't the kind of witch who'd let herself be trapped inside a locked room!!"""
,"The study was no longer a locked room.{n}She could jump from here, escape from here...!"
,The locked room which had threatened to capture the witch and suffocate her had now been destroyed.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""M‐......mm...!! Y‐you too, Kinzo...!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Go. From the moment Battler showed his answer, my spirit had already escaped from this room."""
,"Kinzo's form became a group of gold butterflies and disappeared.{n}The locked‐room barrier had dissolved, and the power which denies magic had scattered."
,Beato ran towards the window.{n}......That was the only exit from the locked room of this witch hunt.
,"After glancing at the Inquisitors and the Chiester Sisters, she readied her wound‐covered body and ran towards the window, just like Battler had done."
,She looked like Cinderella running as she heard the bell toll.
Furudo Erika,"""Y‐you're not getting away, {f:5:Beatrice}, you witch illusion!!"""
,"Erika flew at Beato, trying to grab onto her as she dashed away, but it was like trying to catch smoke, and Erika landed face‐first on the floor."
,"......There's no way a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can catch a witch.{n}For one such as her, without love, even touching Beato was impossible...!"
Furudo Erika,"""Chiester Troops, shoot the witch! Shoot her dead!!"""
Chiester00,"""Alignment conflict. Unable to fire."""
Gertrude,"""For your attention: we have no barrier prepared which can block Battler's blue truth."""
,Both Chiester00 and Gertrude spoke with unbelievably calm voices.
Furudo Erika,"""N‐no one can stop any of them? Not Battler? Or Kinzo? Or {f:5:Beatrice}?! If these guys escape, then......m‐......my locked room, my deduction...!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""And I......the detective, ...Furudo...Erika...kkg{0}g{0}g{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}h{0}hgh! Gyaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"""
,"Erika crouched, screaming and clutching at her head."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You're the great Golden Witch! You can't be defeated by something like that geezer's grubby study!! It's still just the first twilight! Show these newcomers that your game isn't that easy!!"""
,"Just like Battler, Beato also......jumped."
,She drifted down through the gemdrop jewelry‐box world into Battler's chest.
,......Battler caught her with both arms as though catching an angel's wings.
,"It was like a knight catching a princess who had been locked up in a tower, ......like a beautiful picture of a scene in some fairy tale..."
Gaap,""".........Crap, ......I think I'm in love. ...Are all the Ushiromiya family heads guys like this?"""
Ronove,"""If you were to chronicle all the daring exploits of Ushiromiya Kinzo, ......you would probably have a tale longer and wilder than all the grimoires in the study put together. It seems the tale of the next head will be worth writing down as well. In fact, it already is being written. It's already a very, very long tale. ......Pu ku ku ku."""
,"The demons giggled on top of the roof, holding umbrellas.{n}Then, they quietly looked down over the two in the courtyard."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hah, hahhahhahahahahahaha... ......You're......not bad at all......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I guess all your games've toughened me up."""
,"In shock, Beato.....actually praised Battler as he held her in his arms."
,Battler laughed in his usual carefree way......
Furudo Erika,""".........Th‐......this is.........impossible...impossible!!"""
,"Erika looked down from the window and clenched her teeth, still clutching at her head."
,"Still holding Beato in his arms, Battler grinned back."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Erika."""
Furudo Erika,"""......Wh‐...what is it...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I'm not giving the riddle of the Golden Witch up to you. I'm going to solve it. ......That riddle belongs to the two of us. Right, Beato?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Y‐......yes...! My riddle is...yo‐......yo‐......"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yo?"""
,"As Battler gave her a mischievous grin, Beato's face turned uncharacteristically red. But even so, she spoke with a refreshingly bright expression while laughing loudly."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""My riddle is...yo‐......yours......yours alone...!! Ushiromiya Battler! I won't let anyone else solve it...!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heheh, listen to her, saying something like that...!!"""
,"Battler snorted, amused that Beato had said something so unlike her."
,"And, still holding Beato in his arms, he spun around in a kind of waltz."
,The falling gemdrops celebrated their overcoming of this trial......
Furudo Erika,""".........He jumped down from the third floor...? ......Unharmed...? He jumped down......and escaped from the locked room...? Th‐this is ridiculous...... This isn't reasoning... ......It's insane!!"""
,"If Battler had at least been seriously injured and writhing in the mud, ......Erika might still have had some ground to stand on."
,She might have been able to claim that Kinzo couldn't have jumped down with his old body and gotten away unscathed.
,"......However, Battler stood calmly in the courtyard, looking up at Erika with the dignity of the victor."
Furudo Erika,"""Le‐...let me ask all of you again. ......This...can't be possible, right? There's no way a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can jump out of a third story window and land unharmed...!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Isn't that right, everyone...?! Much less Kinzo‐san, jumping down from the third floor at his age!! There's no reasoning behind this!!"""
,"Erika tried to get everyone's agreement and somehow turn things around, ......but their responses were no different from how they had been a short while ago."
Nanjo Terumasa,"""No, with Kinzo‐san, it's a possibility."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Wouldn't put it past Dad."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This is Father we're talking about......"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""There're plenty of crazy stories about that man. Somethin' like this wouldn't surprise me at all."""
Furudo Erika,"""Wh‐......what.........?!! I‐...is there something wrong in your heads, in your minds, people?!?!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""At any rate, ......it looks like your locked‐room argument wasn't perfect."""
Furudo Erika,"""Ah......gggrrrrrrrrggh...!!"""
,"Not only the servants, but the family members also agreed."
,They all agreed that there would be nothing strange about Kinzo jumping down from a third‐floor window.
,J‐just who in the world...is this Ushiromiya Kinzo person...?!!
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Well, I'll give you 60 points... Kinzo would have done it with a bit more flash in his younger days. It needs some more tweaking."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh, and how much should it be tweaked?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""W‐well... Umm, ......h‐he might have jumped down with me in h‐his arms!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Got it. Next time we do this, I'll jump down with you in my arms."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I, ......I'd like to see you try..."""
,"Beato's voice went very shrill, and she gulped."
,"Then, her body suddenly became a group of gold butterflies and crumbled away."
,"It was because many people had rushed up to the window, and she was being bathed with gazes filled with the anti‐magic toxin."
,Beato's body became invisible to them and melted into the air...
,"So to their eyes, it appeared that Battler was standing all alone out in the courtyard..."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Battleeeeeeeeer!! You okaaaaaaaaay?!!"""
Shannon,"""I‐it looks like he's alright...! Thank goodness!"""
Dlanor,"""......I am {f:5:defeated}... ......In that case, for the benefit of the people in the study, ......deliver me the final {f:5:blow}. Use your final blue truth to show how Kinzo escaped from the locked room of that {f:5:study}."""
,There was no pain in Dlanor's expression.{n}...Pleasure and pain never showed up on her face in the first place.
,"However, she used her longsword as a crutch as she struggled to her feet, so it was easy to tell that she had taken heavy damage."
,"And despite her lack of an expression, you could tell that this was a loss she could accept."
,Battler and Dlanor turned to face each other.
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Here I go."""
Dlanor,"""Yes, {f:5:come}. ....................."""
,"As though readying herself, Dlanor quietly closed her eyes, but she still stood tall and maintained her air of dignity."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""This is my blue truth."""
,The blue power gathered.{n}......Battler slowly approached Dlanor.
,"Then, he faced the rainy sky and yelled out the blue truth."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo escaped from the study through the window when Aunt Natsuhi couldn't see him. Aunt Natsuhi didn't notice and locked the window. This way, Aunt Natsuhi can see Grandfather go to bed at eleven o'clock and Grandfather can escape from the study without contradicting the lock of the window or the door sealed by the receipt. I proved through my demonstration that this escape was physically possible. Therefore, this battle is over}!!"""
,"The blue wedge flashed through the courtyard along with a blue bolt of lightning, and roared down towards Dlanor's forehead as she stared up at the sky."
Dlanor,"""........................ah."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Beato's games are no walk in the park. It's doubtful whether the conventions of the mystery genre even apply here. Your swordsmanship isn't bad, but you should be a bit more flexible in your thinking."""
,......A massive blue wedge which looked like a pillar......was above Dlanor's forehead......and had stopped with its tip just slightly touching her.
,It didn't run her through.
,......It made no mark larger than being poked with a pencil.
,"When Battler snapped his fingers, the blue wedge shattered, and became a shower of translucent gems, .........no, drops of rain that poured down over the courtyard."
,Dlanor sat down in an absent sort of way...
,"Amidst the thunder and rain, the successor to the Ushiromiya family faced the people staring down from the study......and spread his arms wide..."
