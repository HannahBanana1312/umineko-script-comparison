Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Well then. ...Was the game just now enjoyable?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......A game that one-sided goes beyond something worth seeing. It's boring."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*. My, my, your point is harsh as always. ......I was only bragging that this development was compelling enough to satisfy even the boredom-hating Lady Bernkastel. What a harsh response."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Well, I'll accept that it was compelling. ...However, it was horrible as a fair game. You need the conditions to be a little more even-"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Are you saying that there's no way to win? Even for Lady Bernkastel? ......*cackle*cackle*."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...............I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""There's no need to trick me. I already know. ...That you aren't a bystander."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""....................."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Were you planning on hiding it? You're an outrageous person to come into someone else's territory from such a great distance and work against me. You came to watch from the sidelines, and probably to push strongly for my defeat. I've guessed right, haven't I...?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".................. And if so?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......*cackle*cackle*! Truly interesting! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"That I should be granted a chance to fight with Lady Bernkastel, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady Lambdadelta, is truly a pleasure!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Yes. I'm also pleased. I really wanted to see you, brimming with confidence, fall apart and lose, so I came all this way."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What an honest person. *cackle*cackle*!! "
{f:5:Beatrice},"Even so, it would be a shame if the contest between me and the great Lady Bernkastel was resolved without at least one observer."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".....................You called her, didn't you. That child."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho! I found you, I've finally found you, Bernkastel!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............How are you, Lambda? Looks like you also have free time. I wonder if it's fate that the pair who hate boredom should run into each other again...?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Stupid kid. Why can't you realize that the only reason you won against me was because of a little luck and a problem of compatibility? After that, you became such a braggart, and now you're even picking a fight with Beatrice? Shouldn't you learn your place?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""*giggle*, Beatrice is strong. And she's even more brutal than I am. Just a little!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""And by the way, don't just shorten someone else's name to Lambda!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........You're dumb too, Beato. If this kid's in your game, she'll make a mess of everything."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I really didn't just bring Lady Lambdadelta here to watch from the sidelines. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"After informing me that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".....................You're still holding a grudge, aren't you."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!! Because I'm the strongest witch in the universe. But I lost to you so I'm not the strongest! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"So anyone who is your enemy is my ally!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*! In that case, with the great Lady Bernkastel as our opponent, it may not count as a handicap, but it will be suitable for entertainment."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............Do as you like. ...Now that I've been exposed, allow me to get serious."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That would be suitable. 'Going easy' has never been written in my dictionary. *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! Lady Lambdadelta, let us enjoy our valuable relationship this time."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Yes, I'll be counting on you, Lady Beatrice! I've been terribly betrayed by her. Unless the two of us smash her up and pay her back double, I won't be able to rest!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............I'll be counting on you, Lambda. And Beato. ...No matter what issue we fight over, this will be a very significant battle for us."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""That's right. Of course, I don't feel like losing, but who wins and who loses will be important."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Anyways, we hate boredom."""
,"The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......That's right. I should thank you, Beato. It looks like I can finally escape boredom. Do your best to entertain me. Together with Lambdadelta."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Leave it to me. *cackle*cackle*...!!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""If we're decided, Beato, then let's start a strategy meeting right now! I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'll teach you all of them!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And yet, Lady Lambdadelta, you were defeated by her, *cackle*cackle*...!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you! Tsu-n!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle* hahhahahahahahaha! ...She's never boring, that Lady Lambdadelta."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............Isn't she? Take care of her. She's a lonely person."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I see. So she's one of 'those' that are popular these days. *cackle*, as expected from Lady Lambdadelta. Quite cutting edge. *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Go already. That child's waiting for you to chase after her."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Then, if you'll excuse me. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"See you next game. *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......I'm sorry. That troublesome one came, but don't mind it."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," More importantly, .........things sure got ugly."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," I thought I'd experienced a very tragic end in Lambda's game, .........but this time, ......it's exceptionally horrible."
{f:5:Bernkastel},...It isn't as though I don't understand that feeling which makes you hug your knees and close your heart.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," If you meet that end several more times, your heart will be killed without having to wait one hundred years."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......Beato saw through me, so I'll confess."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented by a witch, in a manner of speaking."
{f:5:Bernkastel},...I am a witch who was born from there.
{f:5:Bernkastel},......So maybe I'm like an older sister to you.{n} So I decided that I'd lend you my power.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," However, ............even compared to my fate, ......yours is...truly brutal."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," But please, don't lose heart.{n} Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," I've only been allowed a glimpse of the game board, but the unfair and clever devices set up on the stage are so disgusting that they probably far surpass those of Lambdadelta's game board."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," And what's even more frightening, is when that child moves a piece, it's not like she always makes the best possible move."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," This is where she is very different from Lambda.{n} Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces to make the best possible move, in order to win."
{f:5:Bernkastel}, But Beato sometimes intentionally cuts corners when she moves her pieces.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Since when we are in trouble, we try to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at their moves, this creates a very formidable amount of noise in our information."
{f:5:Bernkastel}, This could cause a troublesome amount of disorder.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......However, as in chess, a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, but they would still miss out on a more valuable move."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of it are zero."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Although you may not be able to believe it, this game was also like that."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......Even though those developments looked so overpowering, ...there actually was a weak point."
{f:5:Bernkastel}, One that makes me want to take advantage of it.
{f:5:Bernkastel},......Even though I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Anyway, don't surrender.{n} Don't stop thinking.{n} Don't deny any possibility."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," What's the most important element in defense during a witch's battle? {n}Rather than trying to win, try not to lose."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"...If you lose when you accept her, then you definitely must not accept her."
{f:5:Bernkastel},......Making you accept witches.{n} There is no longer any doubt that this is one of Beatrice's victory conditions.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Now that I have announced that I am your ally, I too will make as great an effort as possible to lend you my power."
{f:5:Bernkastel}, Make an effort yourself as well.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......Umm, in times like this, what did I used to say again?"
{f:5:Bernkastel},".........Umm, uh, {n}.........Fi, ...fight, oh~. Mii, nipa~☆"
{f:5:Bernkastel},"............It's so embarrassing, doing this."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......I've done this much for you, so quickly stand back up."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...Ah, there you are. I wonder where Bern shrank off to? *giggle*, could she be any more lame?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"Even so.{n} Just like usual, the pieces Bern chooses are pretty shabby."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," It's the same with chess, right? {n}If all of your pieces were pawns, you would have zero chance to win, right? {n}If all of your pieces were rooks and bishops, you definitely wouldn't lose."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"......W, well, last time, I felt just a little pity and said that she could advance her pieces from anywhere she wants, and then that idiot Bern, without taking notice of my compassion, started with a-ll of her pawns on my side of the board!! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"What's up with that, that wasn't a loss or anything!! Aaah, just remembering that makes me queasy."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Because of that, I won't be able to rest until I see Bern's speechless face."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Because of that, and because someone like you is Bern's piece, I'm feeling just great! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"And also, I'd really hate that girl even if I didn't lose, so I'll definitely make her grind her teeth in regret, crying like a baby, she's so lame, *giggle*, hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"C'mon, laugh with me, oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta},............Wait a sec.{n} Are you still hugging your knees? 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious? 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},Could you be any more pathetic? 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," I, the great Lady Lambdadelta, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe, will associate myself just a tiny bit with you and your hopeless chances at winning. You should thank me."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," You know, Beatrice may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}, Why? Because she's soft.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," While that kid will frame the board so that she can win with just a few more moves, she will intentionally not corner you."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}, She'll do things like take worthless pieces and place excess pieces on the board to make things one-sided.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," In short, you could say she has the bad habit of playing around by making it look like she's won."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Almost all of the various attacks that are painful for you and Bern, look like utter waste and overkill to me."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"...In other words, this means that she has a weakness, and you have a chance. See? She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right? "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"She is sometimes mistaken in her strategy and goals.{n} And she has too much bad fun.{n} As a result, she even makes and exposes her own weak points."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}, It's impossible for one of the strongest witches like me to understand why she acts so relaxed.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}, Why she lowers her own chances of winning.
{f:5:Lambdadelta},".........But, well."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Because of that, the type of witch like Bern, who thoroughly reads her opponent, has a really bad affinity with her. Because reading her doesn't work."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},...Maybe it's really easy for Bern to read and handle an obedient and honest type like me. It makes me mad!
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"...Well, still, a super firepower type like me can flat out beat up a light, wide-range barrage type like Beatrice, so it's kinda like rock-paper-scissors."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," If I'm paper, Beato is rock.{n} Which means Bern is scissors.{n} Well, maybe that doesn't matter."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Even though my paper loses to Bern's scissors, if it was super-paper, which is far more awesome than normal paper, it could even beat scissors, right?! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"In other words, I, Lady Lambdadelta, am super-paper!{n} Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"It looks like you regained a little of your complexion.{n} That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," At a glance, you'd think she has a really bad habit, right?{n} Wrong."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"......She's just killing time, hoping that you'll stand back up and return."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}, It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by intentionally doing something detestable.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Ah man, I hate kids like that! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"Well then, I'll return."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}, Ah! Don't tell anyone that I helped you out just a little bit! 
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my seat as the strongest stolen when I lost to Bern! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"So I have to take that seat back from Bern, but if Bern loses to Beato here, then the position of the strongest will be moved to Beato this time, right?!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"...Well, I'm not really complaining."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," It would be easier to steal it back from Beato, but then I wouldn't be satisfied, you see?! {n}And I'll take back my position as the strongest! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?! {n}I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry!"
