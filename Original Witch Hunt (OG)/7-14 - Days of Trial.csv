Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
Willard H. Wright,"""........."""
,"""......This form is..."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I'm lending it to you. After all, I hate idiots. ......*giggle*giggle*. Call yourself Clair, as a temporary name. Or would you prefer Beato?"""
Clair,"""...............You have my gratitude. This way, I won't have to expose my pitiful form."""
,Bernkastel had given Clair a fake form.
," It was a temporary form, for the person acting the part of Beatrice. A fake to fool those who still hadn't discovered Beatrice's true form......"
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Then... is this a tale... about me in another world?"""
Clair,"""Lion. ......This is a tale of you in another world, and also my tale. ......The tale of the world where I live as a witch, not a human..."""
Ushiromiya Lion,""".........I am capable of imagining 'what if' scenarios for my own life. ......However, the tale you tell......is beyond anything I can imagine..."""
Willard H. Wright,"""Even so, ......it's the life that another 'you' has led."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""But still! That doesn't mean I can accept it easily."""
,Lion suddenly yelled and looked at the floor. Lion already knew.
," Because of the Fragments lent by Bernkastel, Lion knew."
," This was a different world, where the same person lived as the Golden Witch Beatrice."
," And, in this world, ......eventually, .........on the day of the 1986 October family conference, ......this person would be the ringleader of a terrible crime."
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Even if it is a different world, ......you're saying that I get my entire family and all of the servants involved in a terrible crime that I'm the mastermind of! How am I supposed to deal with that?!"""
Willard H. Wright,""".........Be quiet, listen, and figure it out."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""In a different life, I end up as a servant! And if that wasn't enough, I suddenly become a witch! And then, I eventually carry out several terrifying murders...! How am I supposed to figure that out?!"""
Clair,"""............"""
Willard H. Wright,"""Yeah, I see where you're coming from. ......I doubt anyone could understand. ......This person here thought that no one would ever understand. That's why you're here. ......That's why Bernkastel brought you two, two people who never should have met, together like this."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........It's not like I had any deep reason for it. It was just a whim."""
Willard H. Wright,"""It's a motive that no one else can understand, Lion, so you need to be the one to understand it. I'm not the main character in this tale. You are. ......I'm just here to help you understand."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""You said that you understood the culprit's motive."""
Willard H. Wright,"""......I did."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Is it...a satisfying motive for explaining why I'd kill my entire family...?!"""
Willard H. Wright,"""Who knows. That's for you to decide. Even if I say it's satisfying, that doesn't mean it'll satisfy you. ......You have to decide that for yourself."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I really don't have a clue what's going on...! I've seen several crimes called game boards that Beatrice supposedly carried out. And now, I'm hearing another me talk about a different life from mine. But none of that fits with the crime! I don't understand!!"""
Clair,""".........At this point in the tale, .....even I... could not have dreamed that I would eventually carry out such terrible crimes. In fact, even if I could have dreamed it, ......I did not have the power to commit those crimes at that time."""
Willard H. Wright,"""Probably. ......Your misfortune probably came... when you solved the epitaph's riddle."""
Ushiromiya Lion,""".........Huh? You mean that epitaph about the hidden gold, which Grandfather supposedly wrote...?!"""
Willard H. Wright,"""First, a system for gaining different accomplices for each crime. ......Reasoning leads us to the possibility that the culprit possesses a vast amount of money. And, ...the other system... for inviting all to the Golden Land......and making all loves bear fruit."""
Clair,"""......It wasn't just the motive. So, you've already seen that far."""
Willard H. Wright,"""That's the answer to the final riddle in the 4th game. ......Your great misfortune was solving the epitaph, ......reviving as the Golden Witch in the truest sense, and gaining magical power."""
Clair,"""......Looking back, ......perhaps that was an ill-fortuned event. ......I do not know. However, as long as the fact that Battler-san returns in 1986 remains unchanged, ......some sort of tragedy would certainly have occurred."""
Willard H. Wright,"""That's right. ......If Battler had returned a year earlier or later, ......that incident might not have occurred."""
,"No, some small incident would probably have occurred."
," And it would surely have been a mysterious, impossible incident, which no one could understand."
," But even so, compared to the Rokkenjima serial murders, it would be a tiny thing......"
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......If Battler-kun......had returned a year earlier or later, ...then what?"""
Clair,"""...............Fate can be so filled with irony. ......It made me walk the path of a witch, ......and when I solved the epitaph, I became a true witch. ......Then, six years passed, and I learned of his return. ......If all of that was fate, ......then this crime must have been inevitable and inescapable for me."""
Willard H. Wright,"""In 1980, when Asumu, his mother, died, and his father remarried too soon for his liking, Battler left the Ushiromiya family. And for six whole years, he had no direct contact with the family."""
,He convinced his grandparents on his mother's side to help him and had his last name changed to his mother's maiden name.
," Then, when those grandparents passed away, he finally made up with Rudolf...and returned to the Ushiromiya family again in 1986..."
Willard H. Wright,"""That bad luck......gave birth to your motive for the crime."""
Clair,"""......I did wonder. ......Why, after six whole years, ......did he finally come back?"""
Willard H. Wright,"""I understand. In a way, ......it would have been better for you if he had never come back."""
Clair,"""Of course, my suffering would have continued. ......However, I would not have tainted myself with the unforgivable crime of mass murder."""
Ushiromiya Lion,""".........How could Battler-kun leaving create a motive?"""
Willard H. Wright,"""You've got it backwards."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......Backwards?"""
Willard H. Wright,"""The crime didn't occur because Battler left. ......It happened because Battler came back."""
Clair,"""..................The more I think about it, ......Ushiromiya Battler... was quite a disagreeable man. More than anything else, because he never realized that the outbreak of the crime was his fault."""
Willard H. Wright,"""He did remember, in the end. ......However, that was long after you gave up and disappeared."""
Clair,"""......If that is so, ......then it would give my heart some peace..."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""I don't have a clue what you two are talking about anymore. ......But I'd like to ask you straightforwardly. I want to know. ......What on Earth happened to you that made you decide to commit the crime?"""
Willard H. Wright,"""Yes. That's the most important part. ......Just like how Ushiromiya Battler respected the 'why dunnit' in mystery novels. .........In the tale of the Golden Witch and in the game, ......the answers to all the riddles are hidden there."""
Clair,"""In that case, .........allow me to continue. ......1980. ......Six years before I resolved myself to committing the crime."""
Shannon,"""......Battler-sama.........has left the Ushiromiya family......?"""
,"""That's what Krauss-sama and Rudolf-sama were saying! What a shock!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I have no intention of criticizing your way of life or your family situation. However, Father is in a towering rage. Disinheriting a son is one thing, but I've never even heard of a child becoming fed up and leaving the family on his own."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......That Battler can get annoyingly stubborn. Sort of like someone else we know."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""If you are unable to understand Battler-kun's feelings, I believe that would make you a failure as a father."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Enough, Natsuhi. I'm sure Rudolf was just trying to show how dedicated he was to raising Kyrie-san's child, in his own way."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That would be perfectly satisfactory if it happened next year. ......But why this year? He's still in his period of mourning. ......If you consider the timing of this pregnancy, one must acknowledge that Rudolf-san has acted disgracefully."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Come on, don't be so harsh. ......This is my way of atoning for what I've done..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Battler-kun feels as though he's resisting you for the sake of his departed mother, Asumu-san. ......I deeply understand how he feels. If he were here, I would like to hold him and cry along with him."""
,Natsuhi's words were sharp. They pierced Rudolf mercilessly.
," Rudolf had no retort. His relationship with Kyrie had been improper, plain and simple."
,"......According to Rudolf, he had been close to Kyrie longer than Asumu."
," And, even after his marriage to Asumu, that relationship had not disappeared......"
Ushiromiya Battler, What the hell?! You old bastard!! 
Ushiromiya Battler,"So, that just means you've been betraying Mom from the start!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Sure, I know Kyrie-san. You've told me that she was your business partner and a friend whose advice you could always rely on! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"If you're trying to say after all this time that she was more than that, then why should I give a damn?!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Now that Mom's dead, you can do whatever you want! I'm right there with you, saying that you should live life as you please! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"But just when did Kyrie-san get pregnant?! Back when Mom was still alive, right?! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Yeah, now I finally see! This is why you always make me want to vomit! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Are you glad that Mom is finally dead now? You are, aren't you?! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"I'm sure it'd have been so hard on you, keeping your infidelity and even a kid secret while Mom was still alive!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"But now that Mom conveniently kicked it, you get to marry Kyrie-san, and I get a new little brother or sister!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"You can bet that Mom's crying in heaven!! You bastard, you're embarrassing!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,I'm embarrassed!! So embarrassed I can't stand to have the same last name as you!! 
Ushiromiya Battler,The kid is completely guiltless. He or she'll need two parents to look after him or her. Go ahead and build a new family to give that kid a happy life!! 
Ushiromiya Battler,But I'll never forgive you!! 
Ushiromiya Battler,Mom isn't here to hate you anymore!! So I'll hate you in her place!! With all of my body and soul!! 
Ushiromiya Battler,"So long, old bastard!!"
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""............"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""That is enough, Natsuhi. ......Rudolf hasn't lost the affection he feels for Battler-kun. ......It may take some time, but he wants to fix their relationship one day."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""As any father should. ......This is your own flesh and blood son. This is clearly your responsibility."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Go ahead. Despise me all you want. I won't argue. ......That's the only way I can atone."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""At the very least, make sure you give the new child a happy life."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......The new kid......and Battler. ......They're both my kids."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Wedding Kyrie-san after Asumu-san's death may have been painful for Battler-kun, ......but it was the best choice you could make for the coming child. ......I understand why you did it."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""And I understand why Battler-kun felt like telling you that you were happy Asumu-san is dead."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Stop, Natsuhi. ......Rudolf has already been scolded enough from the person most fit to do so."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Now then, how about some black tea? Could you go ask someone in the kitchen to make us some?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,""".........Understood."""
,Natsuhi took this as a signal to leave the room and did so.
," Once she left, Krauss relaxed slightly."
Ushiromiya Krauss,""".........I feel bad for Asumu-san, ......but if we consider the timing of that child's birth, this might have been quite the coincidence."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Almost as though......Asumu knew that, and stepped down from the stage of her own choosing. ......Did I kill Asumu...? ......If so, ......then how long has it been since I started killing her..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""If you still treasure Asumu-san's memory, ......then, though it may take several years, you must fix your relationship with Battler-kun."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Yeah. ......I know."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""And be sure to pour just as much affection on Kyrie-san and the new child that is to be born. ......While also bearing Asumu-san's cross."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""..................If they have reserved seating in hell..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Hmm?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""If they did, ......I'd like to reserve myself a spot near the top......"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""............"""
,The news that Battler had left the Ushiromiya family swept across the family.
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""And poor Battler-san, too...... I do believe that they will make up eventually, but......"""
Ronoue Genji,"""......This is a matter for the family. We servants have nothing to do with it. Instead, we should focus on memorizing the face of the newest member of the Ushiromiya family, Kyrie-sama."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Yes, that's true. She will be coming to the family conference this year......"""
,If the person who would be joining the Ushiromiya family would be coming to the conference...
,......Then what about the person who just left the Ushiromiya family...?
,"""That means Battler isn't coming, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That seems the most probable outcome. How lonely is the loss of a single, noisy man."""
,"Though most people felt a bit lonely to see Battler leave the Ushiromiya family, they didn't think any more about it than that."
," However, ......what about Shannon? "
,Wasn't Battler supposed to come for her on a white horse......? 
,I was surprised at first.
," I thought that, since he had left the family, he might not be coming to this island anymore."
,"......If we consider Battler-san's feelings, this is only natural, I guess."
, I understand painfully well why he wanted to leave his family...
," But, ......does that really mean he won't come to Rokkenjima anymore...? "
,What on Earth is going on? Will he really never return? 
,"Unable to ask him this directly, I was forced to live each day fretfully..."
,......Battler-san. I understand how you feel......
, But.........
,".........To say that you'll never return because you've abandoned your family... ...That's a lie, right......? "
,I was so confused that the world seemed to be spinning around me...
," I have a tight feeling in my chest, and I can't think about anything."
," When I happened to touch my cheek, ......I was surprised to find it hot and wet."
,"......With a miserable expression on my face, I was... crying......"
,{a:c: Shannon.........Shannon......}
,"From far away, ......I could hear someone calling to me. But it was a very strange sort of distance."
," Though it felt very far away, ......the voice also seemed to be coming from right beside me."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Shannon. I know...your heart..."""
,"""It's okay. ......It's just a fight between a boy and his father. And I'm sure the rumors blow everything out of proportion. Everything's just being exaggerated."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Indeed. There are none who can say with certainty that Battler will not return to this island. You would do well to remain strong."""
,......Where...is this place......? 
,I seem to remember it somehow.
," It's like it reminds me of the scenery of a strange dream I once saw.......Then, ......this must be another dream......"
," I was there, under an arbor in a golden rose garden, and two witches in white and red dresses were showering words of encouragement upon me..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You can be sure that those rumor-mongering young servants are embellishing the story however they please. So, he has changed his name, they say?! Surely, this can be nothing more than a family quarrel."""
Shannon,"""..................Thank you. ......I wish I could believe that..."""
,"""Of course that's true. He's a boy, after all. You can hardly be surprised that he's had a few arguments with his dad."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Precisely, as you say. Clearly, they will make it up to each other once they cool their heads."""
,"""When men argue, it's always fiery at first, but they burn out quickly."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In contrast, an argument between women burns like a steady flame, but the fuel never goes dry. Men's arguments are fierce but short! Quick and easy."""
Shannon,"""......You're right. ......I hope Battler-san and Rudolf-sama......make up soon..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh, they will! Haven't you heard all the times Battler has spoken of it? He always fights with his father! This is just another of those fights. The death of his mother and his father's remarriage have merely upset him."""
,"""It sounds as though he's gone to live with his mother's parents, but after he's cooled his head for a few days, he'll come back. It's like a kid running away from home, see?"""
,The two witches kept saying that Battler's fight hadn't been anything huge.
,"......If it had been a mere family quarrel, the rumors wouldn't have started in the first place. Taking an optimistic view here isn't likely to prove useful..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And either way, this is a problem between Battler and his father. If you're patient, time will heal all wounds! There's no point in you feeling bad over it."""
,"""Just because Battler happened to be absent today doesn't mean we can be sure he'll never come back. All this means is that Rudolf came alone today."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""True. Of course, he will be at the next family conference, as energetic as ever! By then, Rudolf will probably bring that Kyrie here too. Battler may be sulky about it, but I am certain that he will come too!"""
Shannon,"""......You're right. ......Yeah. ......I'm sure...you're right."""
,How nice would it be if they were right...
," In fact, if I could, I'd like to flip through the calendar until autumn right now and check to see whether he does come to the next conference."
," If he does, then all of my fears are groundless."
, It would mean the rumor-mongering family members and servants had just blown things out of proportion......
," If Battler-san were right here, I'd like to question him right away... ...Hey, it isn't true that you'll never come to Rokkenjima again, right...? "
,"And then, if he said that of course he would come again, ......it would be such a relief..."
," I don't know the phone number for Rudolf-sama's house, but I could probably look it up if I tried."
," However, as a servant of the family, I have no excuse for making the call."
," And anyway, I had no way of knowing the phone number at Battler's grandparents' house......"
, I couldn't do anything except wait for Rudolf-sama's family to come visit and hope that my fears were groundless......
," However, will I be able to make it through the day feeling like this...? "
,No way. I doubt I'll sleep a wink tonight.
," Just waiting around, feeling like this, ......when I don't know when my next chance will come... I can't do that..."
," Will it be next month? Or the month after?......In the worst case, I might have to wait until the next family conference."
, And I have to wait that long......while holding back this suffocating feeling......
,......I can't bear it...
,"""Hey, Shannon. Sorry for asking this out of the blue, ......but when you made that decision to do something by the next year, that something wasn't just quitting work as a servant on this island, right?"""
Shannon,"""......Uh, ......that.................."""
,I......made the decision to start a new life.
, I didn't want keep on being a servant by force of habit.
," I made the decision to step into a new life, and to leave my old life as a servant behind."
,"""And Battler promised that he'd come here on the day of your decision, right...?"""
Shannon,"""......Ummm, ......yes..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Tact is not one of my strong points, so I shall speak frankly. You made the decision and resolved yourself to starting a new life with Battler, correct...?"""
Shannon,"""......A new life......with...Battler-san..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You are afraid that Battler will not come for you on the day of your decision. However, there is more to that day of decision than just Battler coming to see you."""
,"""It's also the day for you to show your resolve to spend the rest of your life with Battler."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That resolve resides within you yourself. It is not something that requires Battler's visit to become complete, correct?"""
,"""......Shannon. Do you now have the resolve to spend the rest of your life with him? You decided to put it off until the next family conference because you didn't have that resolve the last time, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What does it mean to live life with Battler? Have you ever thought seriously about it in detail?"""
Shannon,"""Well, ......uh......"""
,"As long as I'm working as a servant on Rokkenjima, my opportunities for meeting him are limited."
," We're both underage, so it's too early to talk about...umm......marriage."
," However, if I quit working as a servant, I should have many more opportunities to meet him."
," Once I quit work here, ......I'll return to the Fukuin House."
," I have my wages for serving the family, so I should have more than enough to travel to Battler-san's house to play."
," And when I graduate from school, I can rent an apartment near to Battler-san's house."
," Then, well......I can work while going to school. That life would be a lot more difficult than I first thought."
,"......However, I'd be able to see Battler-san much, much more often. If not every day, then every week."
," I won't be a servant anymore, so there won't be any difference in class. ......I can call him whenever I want."
, And I'm already doing both school and work.
," Thanks to my experience here, I know more than enough to do simple housework......"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Doesn't that sound like a fun life? You can rent a humble abode, and once you've built up your own home, you can invite Battler over."""
,"""And then, the time you spend together, the world the two of you make, will begin. Doesn't that sound wonderful?"""
Shannon,"""......Y, ......yes. ......It does sound a bit......wonderful..."""
,This was the first time I had ever imagined that future clearly.
," My love for him, and my honest desire to live my life with him. ......Earlier, I was able to consider both of these deeply."
," However, now that I'm clearly imagining the future I plan to choose, I finally understand."
, I must be aware of how much determination will be needed to reach that future.
,"""You dream of marriage, eventually, don't you?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh! Hoh! Girls these days, dating with marriage in mind at such a young age...!"""
Shannon,"""W, well, that's a bit, umm......"""
,"""Don't deny your dreams, okay? There's no point in taking a first step if your eyes are closed and you don't look to the future."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If a girl's in love with a man, there's nothing wrong with thinking 'I wanna marry hi~m'! That's a young girl's natural right."""
,My face had turned bright red.
," Earlier, I thought that considering marriage really was a bit premature, so I tried as best I could not to think about it."
,"......However, now that the witches had encouraged me to imagine it, that image was both exciting and fresh."
," I felt an indescribable feeling of refreshment and awakening, ......like the gentle breeze that washes over you when you go outside during a brief spot of sunshine on a rainy day."
," Certainly, I didn't have determination on that level before now."
, I need to create that determination by the time the next family conference comes around.
," If I can't do that, then sticking around as a servant on this island is no more than I deserve."
,"""And at the same time, this is also a trial."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""True. A trial to be overcome."""
Shannon,"""......A trial...? Why is that...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Fool. Battler promised that he would come for you at the next family conference, did he not?"""
,"""He said he'd come on a white horse, right?"""
Shannon,"""Y, ......yes......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""You are thinking that Battler will not come anymore. In other words, you have no trust in Battler's promise."""
,"""That's why this is a trial. To pass through this trial, you'll have to show that you can trust him and wait."""
Shannon,""".........A trial......"""
,I hadn't thought of it that way.
, Since he promised to come for me in a year... Then I must believe that he will come for me in a year.
,"......If I doubt that, I don't have the right to wait for him in the first place."
,............
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In fact, Battler might have left the Ushiromiya family because he has set his sights on a future with you."""
,"""Oh, why would that be?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If he knows that you will live together and eventually exchange marriage vows, having the name Ushiromiya would cause problems, since Shannon is a servant of the Ushiromiya family."""
,"""Ah, I see! He realizes that there'll be all kinds of trouble if he decides to marry a servant girl, so he's abandoned the Ushiromiya name beforehand...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What do you think, Shannon?! That way, everything makes sense! Battler has abandoned the Ushiromiya name for your sake! This sudden argument with Rudolf was just an excuse."""
,"""What splendid reasoning! Nice going, Riiche!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wahahahahahahahahaha...! What do you say, Shannon? There's no reason to feel down! On the contrary, it's as though Battler has shown his determination first!"""
Shannon,"""......*giggle*. ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*......"""
,"A smile had finally returned to my face. Of course, I hadn't taken the witches seriously and let myself be reassured."
, It was closer to the opposite. It was almost funny that they could think up such ridiculously convenient explanations for everything.
," However, they had made all of those ridiculous theories to cheer me up."
,......The witches are right when they say that I must trust Battler-san... and that there's no point moping about just because I've heard a few rumors.
," Until the next family conference, I intend to strengthen my resolve."
," And, ......I believe that he'll accept my feelings and come for me."
," The idea that Battler left the family so that he could be married to me some day......was laughable, of course."
," But right now, I should try and feel confident enough to accept even crazy ideas like that."
Shannon,"""......Thanks so much. ......I feel a little better now."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is well. I cannot stand watching you cry yourself to sleep."""
Shannon,"""Thanks for coming into my dreams to encourage me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. ......It will be morning soon. This is all a dream. You won't remember any of it when you wake up. However, your heart will be at peace."""
Shannon,""".........Yes. ......I'll believe in him...and wait. ......So, I won't listen to every little rumor."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Very good. Wait until the next conference while improving yourself. If you think of it as training to become a wife, all of your everyday chores will grow more meaningful!"""
Shannon,"""*giggle*. ......Thanks a lot."""
,"""......Riiche. It'll be morning soon."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Is that so? Then so long, Shannon. ......You may not remember me, but I will always be by your side, watching over you......"""
Shannon,"""Thank you...... ......Thank you..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......The next family conference will be here in a flash. ......Wait for it at your leisure... Battler will certainly keep his promise......"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Pleased to meet you. ......My name is Kyrie. I hope we can all become quick friends."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I've known your name longer than I've known Asumu-san's. I hear you're Rudolf's old girlfriend."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""*giggle*. Yes, we've known each other for quite a long time..."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Welcome to the Ushiromiya family. I hope you find it easy to grow comfortable here."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Yes. I'd like to grow comfortable quickly, so that I can support my husband."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""But look at how cute that little girl is. What's her name...?!"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""This is Ange-chan. What a cute name."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,""".........So, you two couldn't make up after all."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I thought this would be the perfect chance to bring him back, but... ...He's as stubborn as Dad."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Will Battler-kun ever come back...? I'll miss him."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Nothing wrong with a man having enough backbone to find his own way in the world. I'm sure he'll have made it big by the time he comes back...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You think so? Right now, Battler-kun's home isn't home for him. There's no reason for him to go back there."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Enough. This concerns Rudolf's family only. It is not our place to meddle."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Thank you, Krauss nii-san. ......This is an issue for our family alone. However, I intend to do all I can to see that Battler-kun and Rudolf-san can live together again someday. After all, he's Ange's one and only big brother."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......Yep. When that kid gets stuck on something, anything you say to him will have the opposite effect. ......Asumu's father has a bit of a short temper. Looks like he's been adding fuel to the fire."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""It'll be okay. I'm sure he'll understand your feelings before too long."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""We can't do anything except cheer you on. ......Even if he doesn't come back, we're all prayin' that the two of you will make up quickly."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......It's a bit boring without Battler."""
Ushiromiya George,"""Yeah. ......I hope he and Rudolf oji-san can make up soon."""
Shannon,"""......If you think about how Battler-sama feels......it must be painful."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""It's like his family's suddenly changed around him. ......It probably doesn't feel comfortable at home anymore."""
Ushiromiya George,"""All men need to go out into the world one day or another. It might just be that Battler-kun's time has come."""
Shannon,"""Do you think so......?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""I do. It's not cool for a guy to hang around at his parents' for too long. You've got to leave the nest in a flurry and make your name in the world. ......I planned to do that eventually, but it looks like he's gone and done it first."""
Shannon,"""A, and when he makes his name in the world and everything, ......will he come back?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""It may be......that he never comes back. After all, this might be leaving the nest to him."""
Shannon,"""......Leaving the nest............"""
,"""Battler didn't come, did he......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh, how terrible. And I kept telling Shannon that he was sure to come. ......I'm sure she feels very upset about Battler not coming. And it's all because I got her hopes up...!"""
,"""She's been looking forward to this day... It pains me to think of how she must feel."""
Shannon,"""............Thanks, you two. ......I'm...okay."""
,I had been reunited with the witches once again in that dream world.
,"......Though I could never remember anything during the day, now that I was in the dream world, I somehow knew that this was a reunion."
, The witches both looked apologetic.
," Though they had tried to cheer me up by saying that Battler would come today, now that he hadn't come, it was like they had been lying, and they seemed to regret it heavily."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Shannon, ......umm......well......"""
Shannon,"""......Thanks for your concern. It'd be a lie to say I wasn't sad, ......but I'll be okay."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""A, are you sure? Really sure? ......That would be splendid, but..."""
,"""Clearly, Battler's fight was so over-the-top that he couldn't bring himself to back down so soon. Men are so stubborn."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Y, yes, that is true...! He tried to act tough before running away, so his stubbornness is preventing him from taking back what he said so easily! He'll probably regret not coming today. Yes, that must be it...!"""
,"For some reason, ......they seemed nearly desperate in their attempts to encourage me."
, It was almost funny to watch. ......I couldn't help but giggle.
Shannon,"""Thanks a lot, both of you. After all, ...you're the ones who told me in the first place. That this is a test...a trial to be overcome."""
,"The truth was, I couldn't really fool myself so easily."
," When will he come back? When will he come for me? When...isn't the question. ......Will he come for me, ever? "
,"If I start moping right now, the uncertainty and sadness will probably tear me apart."
, But they've taught me.
, This is......a test to see whether I really believe in him or not.
, The very fact that I feel uncertain and anxious is a betrayal of my resolve...and of his promise to come for me someday.
Shannon,"""George-sama said something about it. ......He said this might be the same as leaving the nest for Battler-san."""
,"""That's right. This is his chance to leave behind the Ushiromiya name and spread his wings as his own man."""
Shannon,"""If you really think about it, ......we're still very young. Even if we want to be tied together, we're still lacking many years of social experience and trust. If Battler-san is really and truly taking this seriously, ......then it's too soon for him to come for me now."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Well done. Yes, that's the right attitude...! You have done well to reach this understanding."""
Shannon,"""......I haven't reached anything... ......However, I've decided to think of it that way for now. This is a trial...to see whether I trust Battler-san or not."""
,"If he had come today, ......then today, I would have had to tell Madam that I wanted to quit my job as a servant."
," However, was I really prepared to do that? "
,"Last night, I kept worrying about whether Battler-san would come or not."
," Thanks to that, not only did I not have the resolve to quit my job, I hadn't even started on the paperwork to do so."
,"......In short, I still don't have the 'determination' that I promised him that day."
, I'm sure that God knew that. Battler will come for me when I've found my determination.
," I wasn't determined, so it's only natural that he didn't come today......"
,............
,......Yeah. ...It all makes sense now.
Shannon,"""So, ......I'm sure Battler-san didn't come today......because I wasn't determined enough. It's only natural, since I couldn't even truly believe that he would come..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'm sure Battler was the same way. He did not yet have the determination and resolve to come for you."""
,"""......God is not heartless. When your feelings truly do draw close, I'm sure they'll draw the two of you together."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Just like Orihime and Hikoboshi...!"""
Shannon,"""Yes, it's as though the weather just happened to be bad during this year's Tanabata, keeping those lovers apart for another year... ...That's how I'd like to think about what happened today."""
,That's how...I'd like to think about it.
,......I have no other choice.
,............
,......Battler-san......
Ushiromiya Lion,"""But Battler-kun didn't come back for......"""
Willard H. Wright,"""Six years. ......Still a long way to go until then."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""......So, you had to wait six whole years feeling like that...?"""
Clair,"""When one waits every year for something to happen the next, and then the same thing the next year and the next, ......it becomes similar to waiting for an eternity."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Pretty pathetic, don't you think? After all, this promise you thought you made with Battler seems to be something Battler knew nothing about, right?"""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Battler-kun does tend to use melodramatic phrases, just like Rudolf oji-san. ......His roundabout way of putting things might have led to a misunderstanding..."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Some girl's gonna stab Battler in the back someday. ......Well, that's more or less what this tale is."""
Willard H. Wright,"""......When words can mean different things, they can turn a person's life upside-down. ......There are times when careless talk costs lives."""
Clair,"""............"""
