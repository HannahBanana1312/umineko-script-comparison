Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
,The true enemy of a siege isn't the fear of unseen enemies. It's probably about whether you can keep that going over a long period of time.
," Maria had gotten bored and had started making a ruckus because she wanted to watch TV. Since there was no TV in the lobby, we decided to return to the cousins' room on the second floor."
, They probably expected that we wouldn't want to leave Maria all alone. The adults told all the children to go to the second floor cousins' room.
," George, whose heart was wounded by the loss of the person he was engaged to, led the cousins up to the second floor without any resistance."
," At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby, but when he noticed that the relatives looked like they wanted to talk about something sinister, he said 'it seems I am in the way' and returned to his room on the second floor."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""............I'm starving. If we just sit around, we'll get even sleepier."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""It's only natural. Because we didn't sleep last night."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...We will probably end up barricaded here for a full 24 hours. It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over-stressing ourselves."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That's right. My husband and I will be here, so anyone who finds this difficult should rest without overdoing it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Our opponent might be expecting that, right? While they couldn't defeat this many people, if that number was reduced by a certain amount, they may plan to use it to their advantage."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""There are seven of us here. We could take three hour shifts in pairs. ......It's a long time until tomorrow. We still have some energy now, but tonight's going to be tough."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Sure will. Anyone sleepy? Don't overdo it, and rest."""
,"Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered."
,"...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to be able to sleep now.......Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness."
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""......Nobody? Well, don't overdo it, everyone."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If we get tired, then we can think about it. ......I certainly am tired, but I'm not in the mood now."""
,"As Eva spoke sharply, she reminded everyone of the second letter from Beatrice, which had been found in the boiler room."
," Beatrice had sent them two letters, and had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph."
, And she had even provoked them by saying she would give up her assets and the inheritance if it could be solved...
, Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............Is that the epitaph?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes. ......Although it's annoying to do as the culprit says. After all, we do have time to waste. I think it's the perfect way to stave off boredom."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...Not a bad way to kill time. Why don't we challenge it together as siblings?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Can I borrow that? I'll rewrite it just a little larger. Natsuhi-san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""There should be paper in the servant room. I will bring some."""
,Natsuhi immediately brought a B4 blank sheet of paper from the servant room.
," Kyrie borrowed Eva's notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table."
," Then, everyone quickly peered down at it....They automatically crowded around."
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""I've heard about it, but......really, this is a tough riddle. I don't have a clue what it's talking about."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""At one point, I also did my best to challenge it, but I was just as clueless."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""If you did know, you wouldn't have come all the way out here with a plan to make money. After all, it's 10 tons of gold."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............This is the first time I've read it seriously, but......roughly speaking, couldn't it be split into three parts?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...I've been thinking this since last night, but you really are a good thinker, Kyrie-san. It's possible that you could easily solve this riddle that we couldn't."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Yeah. Kyrie's sharp. ......She might be able to tackle it in an interesting way without any strange preconceptions."""
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........That's right. Kyrie-san. Will you openly tell us about your thoughts after reading the epitaph?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I think it probably won't be very useful to all of you. You all give me too much credit."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""No way, anything that comes to mind would be helpful. Let us hear what you have to say. ......Because your hints always help me when I'm worried."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Oh, so they were helpful? It's nice to finally hear about this now."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Come ooon, don't I always thank you?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""You two sure are close. I'm jealous."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And the rest of us would also love to accept your hints. It's alright, we're just killing time anyway, so why not relax?"""
,Kyrie was disturbed at being praised for something so strange.
,"...But they had plenty of time. She realized that this was just a way to waste time, and she decided to accept that role..."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I'm sure I'll say something off the mark, but... well, I'll put forward my ideas."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hmm. ......What did you mean in the beginning, about how, speaking roughly, it could be divided into three parts?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"Well, ...I just mean what I said.{n} I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three parts."
Ushiromiya Kyrie," First, there are the five lines up until 'There sleeps the key to the gold'.{n} Up until this point is the first part, which points to the location of the key."
Ushiromiya Kyrie," And then there's the part formed by the 11 lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the Golden Land itself."
Ushiromiya Kyrie, And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached.
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I see. It can be divided into three parts about the key, the Golden Land, and the Golden Land's treasure."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Even we have been able to grasp that much. The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Nii-san, don't butt in any more than you have to! Let Kyrie-san speak her ideas freely."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Kyrie. Please continue. ......We recognize the same thing regarding what you said. So then?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I wonder what that thing in the beginning, the 'beloved hometown', means. Thinking about it normally, would it refer to Grandfather's hometown?"
Ushiromiya Kyrie," Since he went to all the trouble of telling us that it's beloved, I can imagine that it's a hometown he thought about very deeply. ......Didn't Father come from Odawara?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............Odawara is definitely where he was born, but I don't think this hometown Father loved was Odawara. I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Right. This probably isn't Odawara. From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Hahhaha. ...Father's greatest misfortune in his life was probably being made the Ushiromiya family head."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Probably. Father really hadn't wanted to become the Ushiromiya family head."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""So where is it? And is there a river where sweetfish swim?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Maybe they were there at the time. By now, there has been a lot of development there, and the sweetfish might have disappeared. It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether there were sweetfish there during the time Grandfather was a boy."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""There is no single river, right? I believe we all investigated thoroughly in a geographical sense. ......You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, right Eva?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That was only as a vacation. ......But the townscape had changed completely from Father's time. After all, it was caught up in the war, wasn't it? It was impossible to even figure out where Father actually lived. ...Probably, even if Father dragged himself to the actual location, by now, even he wouldn't be able to determine where it was that he lived."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Because that place has had a remarkable revival..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............After hearing about a sweetfish river, does any place name come clearly to mind?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Well, I wonder. After all, they're sweetfish, right? People say they live in rivers with clean water, so there are countless rivers we could guess at. Any stream that Father innocently went sweetfish-fishing in was probably buried by the development later. It would be different if we had a map from before the war, or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......It probably isn't something like that."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""What do you mean...?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,""".........My beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it. You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream and seek the key. ...After these two lines, there is a single blank line."
Ushiromiya Kyrie," ...Something is being presented with just these two lines. What if the next three lines continue based upon that something?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""What do you mean, something is being presented...?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I don't know. Anyway, these two lines aren't vague about the river, like they don't know which river it is. It clearly specifies this 'river'."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"......It may be that this isn't a 'river' with water flowing down it. ...The 'sweetfish river' might be some kind of metaphor. ......What kind of image does the word sweetfish have?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,""".........Sweetfish are like salmon. They're freshwater fish, but they go out into the ocean right after they're born. And when they get big, they return to the river to live there, and then they spawn there and end their lives there. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"Well, they leave their home at one point, but when they get big and return to lay eggs, that might have a family prosperity type of image."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Hmm. They're freshwater fish, but they can live in the ocean? I didn't know that. I thought they were river fish, so they couldn't go out into the sea."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""And they are called sweetfish because they have a pleasant aroma. I have never eaten one, but I have heard that they are very delicious when grilled with salt."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Whoa, Natsuhi-san! You've never eaten salt-grilled sweetfish?! They're delicious! You should try it sometime soon!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""It is a food for commoners. It isn't appropriate for your mouth."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......This is just my wild idea, ...but the image I get from a sweetfish river makes me suspect a family tree. The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right? .........It makes me think about myself."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You're right. By this point, I can confess that I have sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria-chan."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I see. ......If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village. If you go down the family tree looking for a village, all you find is Maria's name , which has a '{p:0:里}'  character in it."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Isn't that right?! ......But as you all know, Father doesn't like Maria, and he has almost never spoken with her. "
Ushiromiya Rosa,"And, in the past, Father told me to give Maria a completely different name. I just changed it to Maria on my own. Father was very mad about that."
Ushiromiya Rosa," ......If you think about the details there, it's very hard to imagine that he would reference Maria's name in his precious epitaph about who would succeed his wealth and inheritance."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Have you ever let Maria-chan read the epitaph?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Uh, yes, of course. But it looked as though she didn't have a clue. ......She didn't have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a resurrection ceremony for the witch."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""............A connection between Father and Maria. ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted. ...I can't imagine it refers to Maria either."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......What worries me is the fact that he went to all the trouble of adding the word beloved at the beginning. ......Like you all said just now, if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya family head, would he yearn for that? ...I don't think it is Odawara, which points back to the Ushiromiya head family."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"......I believe that this word 'beloved' here at the beginning refers to a place full of very important memories to Father."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""............Hmmmmmm. ...Well, that's fine. It would be hard to pinpoint since we don't have a clue about a map from that time, but anyway, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Father's hometown during his youth."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's if it's a river with water flowing down it, right? And then? Go on, Kyrie-san."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......I don't really understand the three lines starting with 'If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village'. ...That is probably coupled with the two lines about the sweetfish river."
Ushiromiya Kyrie," It's probably something that we would automatically understand if we knew what the sweetfish river really was. ...As long as we don't understand that, it's probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""So we give up unless we know what the 'sweetfish river' really is... And there's no guarantee that it even means a literal river. "
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"...Seriously. What does it mean, sweetfish? Did Father like to eat them? Or is there some special meaning? Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...If you don't have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow. ......It might be better if you don't think too deeply and be flexible, holding an abstract image of a river where fish swim, or something flowing, ...up or down."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""And the answer for the 'sweetfish river' passes through the next three lines and makes its way to the 'key to the Golden Land'..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts. There's actually four parts. ......'Go down the sweetfish river', 'find the key to the Golden Land', 'journey to the Golden Land', 'and the treasure of the Golden Land'."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hmmm.........Truly interesting. Good work. After that, would you tell us your opinion about the most central portion of the epitaph, getting to the Golden Land, up until the tenth twilight?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......That's the most symbolic, ...and also the most disturbing part."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Since it keeps mentioning the word sacrifices, I can't help but think it has something to do with Father's occult ceremonies............How do you see it, Kyrie-san?"""
,"Kyrie recrossed her arms several times, peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it..."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...........................This is...very difficult. ...By starting with 'He who lays hand upon the key', it probably means that you won't be able to continue without understanding the key. ...I'll have to give up, but I'll take a shot at trying to solve it anyway."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Just like how the 'sweetfish river' isn't necessarily a river with water flowing down it, it is also doubtful that this 'key' is actually something shaped like a key."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Right. There's also the possibility that it's a code or a keyword. ......After all, this key isn't something to be stuck into a keyhole. It's something that selects the six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight."
Ushiromiya Kyrie," In that sense, we can state that this key isn't something to open the door to the Golden Land."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......But it is a disturbing key. A key that can select six people to be sacrifices..."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""How would a key select anything? ...Does it spin around like a roulette...?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""This key points towards a certain group of six people. ......No, we should say it points to a certain group of six things, ......if this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices. For example, it could be an anagram."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""An anagram? Do you mean playing with letters...?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Yes. I've kept thinking about it since Rosa started talking about the family tree, and about how village was a part of Maria-chan's name."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"......It seems as though Rudolf-san, for example, has assumed that this has been talking about something related to geography or coordinates since the words 'beloved hometown', but that might not be true. This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......I'm sorry. What is playing with letters?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Oh yeah, it's like 'sucker merry barrels'. Wha-t do you get when you take out the e's and r's? Like that. Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi-san, so you probably don't know."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...Merry?? Take out the e's and r's, huh? ???"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Stop it. It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."""
,Only Natsuhi didn't get it and had a blank look on her face.
," It seemed that she had only guessed the answer had to be something undignified, after hearing Rudolf and Eva's sniggers."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Ah, ...Natsuhi nee-san, it's something like this. This is just something from Maria's book of riddles, okay? There's this thing called the Tanuki Notebook."
Ushiromiya Rosa," It's a notebook written like a code, with a lot of 'ta's mixed in, and if you 'remove' all of the 'ta's, then the true paragraph pops up. It's a game like that."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Ah, ......oh, I see. .........??"""
,"Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............So maybe that 'remove' part is actually represented by 'kill'...?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Yes. I also thought that. It's possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with six characters."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""In other words, ...the 'ta' from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...? Hmmm, ...this is getting complicated..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Playing with letters, is it.........hmmm. In Japan, it really feels like a child's game, but it seems that it a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in English speaking circles. ...It is easy to imagine that Father showed interest in it."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......But by this point, I quickly lose my ability to understand it. Until this part, while it did flow like a riddle, it was extremely sequential."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"'Sweetfish river', 'go down it', 'then find the key', is all extremely sequential. And as a result, we can guess that we gain a six character key, ......but in that case, we now don't know 'what' we kill the six characters from."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""That's right. Where do we pull the six characters from? It doesn't tell us."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...At the second twilight, there are 'those who remain'. ......Which means that, at the very least, that 'something' has a limited number of characters. You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the six characters are removed."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,".........And yet, we don't know what this 'something' is, even though it should have been shown to us at the beginning. ...Were we wrong even to assume that this is playing with letters...?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""..................Hmmmmm..."""
,Everyone crossed their arms and fell into silence.
," It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding that they hadn't been able to before..., but they stumbled just one step before it."
," At that time, Hideyoshi's stomach rumbled heartily."
, The silence up until then was broken by laughter.
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Sorry, sorry. Strangely enough, by spinnin' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach's gone completely empty. Looks like I can't stand missin' breakfast..., wahahahahaha."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Natsuhi. Isn't there anything here?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast. I will prepare it."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I'm also starving. I'll bet those brats above us are starving too. ...But I doubt that there's enough for 18 people here, and for three meals, right?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right. It'll be a long journey until tomorrow. It might be better if we took a trip back to the mansion and fished around for some canned food or something in the kitchen."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""There's nothing more than crackers and snacks, but if that is alright, I can prepare them. But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""That will be fine for now. Would you prepare it for us?"""
,It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.
," The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation team split up for the time being."
, But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""............Playing around with letters was nothing more than my theory. There is a chance that it's mistaken. Eva-san, don't take it too seriously, okay...?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........Thank you. This is something I've decided to do. Would you mind leaving me alone?"""
,Eva spoke coldly.
,"...Kyrie didn't bother her any more, and went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Nee-san. Shouldn't we also help prepare breakfast?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Then you go help. I'm busy solving this!"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""S, sorry... Th, then I'll help..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........Come on. Why are you like that?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Huh?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The Ushiromiya family inheritance will be given to the person who solves this epitaph. It seems as though you've given up from the beginning, as though it has nothing to do with you, but if you could solve it, there's a chance even you could receive the inheritance."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......This is a chance to steal everything from Nii-san. Why aren't you seriously trying to solve it it for that once-in-a-lifetime chance?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""...Um, .........umm, ......I......"""
,"Rosa hung her head, troubled over how she should answer....Too late, she regretted that she had carelessly spoken to her sister when she was in a bad mood."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""If you've noticed anything, say so. Even though Kyrie-san and I were seriously reasoning, you just kept nodding your head, didn't you? Come on. Isn't there anything you've noticed? Come on!"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""............Uh, .........umm, ...............Isn't, ...this strange?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Strange? What is?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Umm, ......this word, Golden Land. The word Golden Land comes up several times."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""So what? Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in 'Golden Land'?"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Um, umm, that's not it. ......Look, isn't just the tenth twilight strange?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............Huh? ......ah."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""Even though they're all written the 'Golden Land' ({p:0:黄金郷}), for some reason, only this place has the 'village of gold' {c:86EF9C:({p:0:黄金の郷})}. He went to all the trouble of mixing in the character '{p:0:の}'. It vaguely bugged me that it's only said differently here... "
Ushiromiya Rosa,".........ah, umm, ...it's not like it means anything. This is Father we're talking about. It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""........................"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Boring."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Oh, what is boring...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Boring, boring."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""My, my. I don't have a clue what this child is grumbling about."""
Ronove,"""She is probably dissatisfied that you gave Battler-sama various hints, Madam."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......No-t really. That's not unsatisfying. I'm actually more satisfied now that that worthless Battler has finally reached the level where he can go along with me."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hoh-hoh-ho... Were you a little too friendly with Battler-kun? Maybe it would be better if the old people went away and left everything to the young kids."""
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku ku ku..."""
,"When Virgilia and Ronove giggled and cackled, Beatrice's irritation meter finally reached its limit."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Heeey, you're all laughing at me! Ronove, hide yourself for a while! Disappear, disappe-ar!"""
Ronove,"""Certainly. Then, I will rest for a while. Pu kukukuku..."""
,"Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and hid himself."
," After that, all that remained was the figure of Beatrice, who was grumpy and irritated, and Virgilia, who was cooly enjoying her tea."
{f:5:Virgilia},"""............When you said '{p:1:There are no more than 18 people on this island}', you actually cornered yourself."""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........I thought so............I thought it might have been a little too early, but.........was it really too early after all......?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""If you had led him further astray beforehand, things might have been different, but it really was a futile trump card. You stirred him up instead."""
,"In addition to his victory condition of denying the witch, Battler had held onto a different victory condition, since he had wanted to explain things without suspecting someone of the 18."
, Hadn't he been weakest when he had been tossed about by two opposing goals? 
,"However, Beatrice had used the red carelessly, and had proclaimed that there were no more than 18 people."
,"...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18, .........and he had finally begun to build up the readiness that he needed to accept that."
," Battler was stubborn, but because of that, when he was struck where he was fragile, fissures would crack all over him, like breaking china."
," That itself should have been his greatest weak point, but..."
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Kuuuuuu. ......Did I get a little too careless after my complete victory last time......?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Yes, you were too careless. ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler-kun, but it seems that this game will become a difficult one for you."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......A broken vase will definitely never return to its original form. ...So it would be more constructive to think of the next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces."
{f:5:Beatrice},".........However, now that Battler has been instigated this much, how should I plot against him...?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hoh-hoh-ho. Your troubled face is an even better snack than Ronove's cookies."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Uu-. You and Battler and even Ronove are making fun of me. ...Even though I'm not naive at a-ll."""
,"With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler, Beatrice rolled her head around on top of the table."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............Teacheeer. .........At least a hi-nt."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Oh. What kind of hint?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If you know a skillful move that will make Battler speechless, and make him accept me, I won't ask you to say it outright, so, umm, ...even if it's just a hint."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hoh-hoh-ho, I can't. I am acting as Battler-kun's ally, so I cannot teach you something that would give you an advantage."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...You don't have to say it so stiffly... Even though your disciple's in trouble..."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""I believe you harshly boasted that you had surpassed your teacher, correct?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Uu-... Please act like an old person and give me just a bit of your cunning wisdom... Pleease... It's mean if you only help Battleeer..."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""My, my. You're still a spoiled child."
{f:5:Virgilia},"......But, it's true that I may have given Battler-kun a few too many hints. It did serve as a scolding to you, but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Isn't that right, isn't that right...? Please, Teacheeer, at least just a hint now..."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""...............This is just a hint. Think about what it means by yourself, alright?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yeah, yeah! I'll think about it myself, so please! Please, give me one that'll leave Battler down in the dumps."""
,"It was truly shameful how she behaved when Battler wasn't around, even though she acted utterly like a Great Witch in front of him."
, Virgilia took a deep breath at how Beato was still a child no matter how much time passed.
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Then just a hint. ......Do you know of Aesop's fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Of course. It's a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to steal the cloak of a traveler, right?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""That's right. Violent or impatient methods aren't always necessarily the best decisions."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......You don't have to tell me that. I have already reflected on the fact that I rushed too fast towards victory."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""............ Think well about what this means. And furthermore, ......it seems Battler-kun had a slight misunderstanding, but it also seems that you are misunderstanding something. Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...What else is there, other than making Battler surrender?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},""".........See? At that point, you are already mistaken."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""How am I mistaken?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Your victory isn't making Battler-kun surrender. ......Isn't it making Battler-kun accept your existence?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......What's this? You want me to butter up Battler, asking 'Accept me as a witch, pleease?'! How foolish! I will not sink so low!"""
,"Grrrrrrrrrrr..., Beato growled like a dog in a bad mood."
," Virgilia shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short-tempered as always..."
{f:5:Virgilia},"""That is my hint. Now you should think deeply. .........In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler-kun. A significant tactical conversion will probably be required."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...I'd understand even without you telling me. ......I don't have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun, but anyway, I understand that I will have to change my objective. ......I'll introduce a clever scheme that will surprise even you, Teacher...!"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Hoh-ho-ho... I look forward to it. I wonder how Battler-kun will tackle that. ......I am wishing you good luck as well."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And Battler too, right? Hmm..."""
,""".........Are you going to give up and resign already? If you're that tired, why not just go into a futon and sleep...?"""
,"...As my consciousness grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa, 'I' scolded myself."
,"""......You also dreamed about stealing the position of family head from Krauss, right...? "
,"Even though I gave you that chance with my magic, you're already throwing it away...?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"You could say that, but...{n}............This riddle is really difficult.{n} Even a wire puzzle would be better.{n}...At least in that case, you are assured that it definitely is solvable."
Ushiromiya Eva, But I don't know if there's any assurance whether this riddle of the epitaph is solvable.
Ushiromiya Eva,......I might just be fighting a useless battle.
,"...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook which I had been holding the whole time."
," It was opened to the page with the epitaph, which I had looked at so many nights that I might have burned a hole through it."
,"......That, is truly a door."
," On the other side, there is the 'Golden Land', which I had wished I could drag myself to since I was a child no matter what the effort, ...and which I hadn't been able to drag myself to."
," Am I touching the door with both hands, ...and even though the book, no, the door is open, can I still not reach the other side?"
,"""...That's right. You have already touched the door with your hands. Come, open it with all of your strength. And read the characters written on the door."""
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........Open it, with all my strength. ...Read, the characters written on the door..."""
,Strain your eyes.......See through to the thing beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...
,"""...The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations. ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"That's right...... Then what about the 'sweetfish river'? {n}There are several rivers where they swim, but it is suspicious whether there was one very near the place that Father lived."
Ushiromiya Eva,"...If we start wondering whether there was a nearby river on a map where sweetfish lived..., things will quickly get vague and we won't be able to get specific..."
,"""Didn't you say it yourself? You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it. ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it...? "
,"Think of a river. A river. Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea. Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"""
Ushiromiya Eva,......Not a river? Even though the sweetfish can't swim in it if it isn't a river? 
Ushiromiya Eva,"Oh, but maybe if sweetfish could swim, that means it's tied to the ocean......"
Ushiromiya Eva," Didn't my husband even say that, while they are river fish, they can go out into the ocean..."
Ushiromiya Eva,".........{n}....................................{n}............To the ocean......................No, ...but, {n}...............Huh...?"
,"""......Did you notice? But that's just a faint memory. There should be a book archive somewhere around here. If you investigate, you can make sure."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"......If that was the 'sweetfish river', .........{n}.........And if the key might be a six character word..."
Ushiromiya Eva,..................Was the key really resting in that river? 
,"I, I don't know, I don't know....Anyway, I have to search in an atlas..."
," But, even if I know that, I don't know 'from what' I should take the six characters..."
,"""......You really don't know? Think deeply. .........We're pretty smart, so our ideas are solid."
," Don't think of it like it's something as massive as the riddle of the epitaph, but like it's a child's riddle. ......Men are always children, no matter how old they get. Even if Father has advanced into old age, that doesn't change the fact that he is essentially a child inside his heart."
,".........Throw away your awe of Father. ...Think of this like it's a worthless, infantile game with riddles, like the one Maria suddenly brought up on the boat."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"......Riddles. ......Worthless, infantile."
Ushiromiya Eva,"........................{n}..................Huh, .........ah."
Ushiromiya Eva,".......I'm sure that was, ...what was it, ......umm, umm......"
,"...I'm sure, if my memory isn't wrong, ......that's probably, umm..."
," No, I don't have to rely on my vague memory. I should be able to figure that out immediately by searching in an archive."
,""".........We've probably already noticed the answer. ...All that's left is to research whether that's correct or not."
," Come, Eva. Let's go to the archive and make sure no one notices. ......There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn't fit in Father's study. ...I'm sure that we'll find a book that answers our question. .........Quickly. This is our first and last chance in our life to have our dreams made true."""
,"When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...I'm sorry. It looks like I woke you."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......Eva. If you're sleepy, don't overdo it. You rest first."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Th, ......thank you. I'm just going to the lavatory for a bit to wash my face."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""You should take it easy and rest. ...Is your body troubling you again?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I said I'm really fine! I'll be right back."""
,"After leaving only those words behind, I rapidly left the lobby."
," The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me."
,......The archive was next to the servant room.
," Father always owned a vast book collection, but ever since he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, that collection grew even larger, so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed."
, This archive was where those normal books were stored.
," They were all thick, like complete encyclopedias for intellectuals, but that was very convenient for me now that I was investigating something."
," I entered softly, ......and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there."
, Then I locked it from the inside.
, I actually wasn't thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.
,...What scared me was my fear that one of the siblings might hear what I was investigating.
," My heart had started jumping.........I had been half-asleep until a short time ago, so I hadn't been able to realize how significant this thing I had noticed was."
," But as I had become aware, ......my heart had started to feel like it was about to explode."
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........I, ...wonder if any of the other siblings have noticed this......"""
,I don't think Krauss and Rudolf will notice.{n}......But I don't know about Kyrie.{n} She has extraordinarily good intuition.
,.........And I don't know about Rosa either.
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Rosa is also stupid. She always has been, and surprisingly so."""
,"Really...? I think she was wise enough to make you think she was stupid, so that she didn't earn herself unnecessary malice."
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........Here it is. ...I wonder if we'll find it in this one."""
,"I pulled the book out, and flipped through the pages......"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............Uu. .........This is, ......... a 'sweetfish river'...?"""
,"I see... This is what the sweetfish river means.{n}......Don't dawdle around, research further."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Y, yes, I understand... If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village... By village, does it mean a town or something? That's an area of dense population, so there could be many of those..."""
,"Why have you stopped thinking?! {n}If you don't like it, why not quit...? {n}Why not just hand over the Ushiromiya headship to Kyrie?!"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I, ...I don't want to... I will become the head. ...This is, umm, my first and last chance.........What is '{p:0:里}' (village)? What does it mean?! If you go down the 'river', there's a {p:0:里}......?! ............ah, ......... aaaaaaaahhh......!!"""
,"......In the village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.{n}......It's 'shore' ({p:0:岸}). Understand?"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Uu, ...*gulp*... I, I, I understand...! 'Shore', ......'shore'.........!"""
,"Right before my eyes, ......the pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all, ......began to *snap*, ......*snap*, into place, all by themselves......"
, I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth....My throat grew completely dry...
," Is it, ......really alright for this to be the answer? R, really? Really...?!"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...But this isn't six characters at all. ...I'm absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!"""
,"Did you stop thinking again? In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters."
," If you can't think of one, then research it.{n}......There has to be an answer. You must not doubt that."
," If you can't believe that, why don't you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die...?"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.........Oooh, ...s, ...... six characters..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"......I, ......I found it. ...This, .........is, th, ......the key to the Golden Land.........!!"""
,"Yes. This is, the key to the Golden Land.{n} ......The key, to our childhood dreams."
,"......The only keyhole to stick that key in, is that place.{n} That, is definitely what offers the sacrifices.{n} Now, do you understand............?"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Whaa, ..........whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"""
