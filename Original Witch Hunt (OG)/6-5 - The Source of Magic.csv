Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
Shannon,"""......Back then I was, and I guess I still am, a bit of a klutz... I'd always forget where I'd put things...or intend to lock something but then forget. ......I caused a lot of trouble."""
Ushiromiya George,"""Hahaha, I remember how Natsuhi oba-san used to get mad at you all the time."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""But eventually, Shannon managed to overcome that forgetfulness."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh, and how'd you do that?"""
Shannon,"""......Heheh. It wasn't anything big, ......but I got into the habit of writing things down. I'd write down wherever I put something important. ......For things that happened often, I made a checklist and always made sure to check it......"""
Furudo Erika,"""So? Did you see Beatrice or didn't you?"""
Shannon,"""Oh, umm, ......I didn't see her directly, ......but, umm, ......some very strange things did happen..."""
,She was talking about a certain summer night.
," It was when Shannon was doing the nightly rounds...... From her perspective, it was a ghost story."
," From the witch's perspective, ......it was just the story of a little summer's night prank..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""My little sister. Do you understand the anti-magic toxin that humans possess?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""N, no. What is that, big sister?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hmm. The time of witches has long since passed. ......Those vile humans who claim to control everything came to deny our existence and possess a strong toxin."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Is that toxin harmful to us...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""It is extremely dangerous. If it got to us, our forms would probably evaporate in an instant. However, one thing we do have in our favor is the fact that our existence is still extremely weak. Because of that, the toxin does not affect us greatly. At worst, it can only transform us into mist for a time."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However, we'd rather avoid it if we can, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Correct. Yes, I see that you are me. You understand quickly."""
,"The older sister appeared to be haughty at first, .........but, perhaps because she was so happy to have met her double and little sister, she was more than willing to teach her anything she wanted to know."
," The first thing she had taught her was that they were witches, a different type of being than humans."
," Beato had thought that she wasn't a witch because she couldn't use magic, but apparently, she was still a witch nonetheless."
," Then she was taught that witches such as her, unlike humans, were bound by various restrictions."
, The greatest of those restrictions was the anti-magic toxin possessed by humans.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, in other words, we mustn't enter a human's field of vision..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Correct. You can think of it as though human eyes radiate the toxin. If they see you, it is the same as your body being burnt. Though they are lesser in extent, being heard or sensed can also result in contact with the toxin."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......So, it's dangerous just for us to get close to humans..."""
,Wasn't Father a human...? Why am I not burnt by Father's toxin......?
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If we stock up magical power and have it acknowledged by humans, that toxin can be reduced drastically. In other words, by having our existence acknowledged by humans, we make them lose their toxin, making it possible for us to appear before them once more."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I see...... Simply put, as we are now, we can only exist when humans aren't around..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""We are still very lacking in magical power, which makes us inferior to even a stray cat hiding from humans in the shadows."""
,The main goal of the older sister was to gain a large supply of magical power and be revived as a great witch strong enough to have no fear of the anti-magic toxin.
," For that purpose, she had wandered around the mansion night after night, striving to regain her magical power and reduce the anti-magic power of the humans..."
," The powerful previous Beatrice, whom she had read about in Featherine's library, had appeared openly in front of humans and had even toyed with them at will."
,"......According to her big sister, such a level of power was most impressive."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""To think that a witch could appear openly before humans and use magic at will! ......A witch like that would be so great that even I can hardly imagine it. Is that what we will eventually become?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. ......She was like a witch from a picture book, appearing openly before the humans of the mansion and summoning magic and underlings at will..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hmmm, how inspiring. If that is our future, it means that all of our hard work will have been worth the effort."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That's right. ......Anyway, big sister. How are those efforts and going around unlocking windows like this related...?"""
,It was the middle of the night. They were following behind servants who were checking the locks on the doors and windows and undoing those locks after the servants thought they had locked them.
,......It felt more like a child's prank than the work of a witch...
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Eheheh, this is the path that leads to becoming a great witch. All journeys begin with a single step. To those who cannot understand, that first step may look quite foolish from time to time. However, it is still a momentous first step...!"""
,"With pride, as though making the first step for mankind on the surface of the moon, the older sister undid the lock on a window with a *click*."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Do you not understand, my little sister? Can you not see what makes something like this momentous?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............? No, big sister. ......I don't really understand."""
,"The older sister closed her eyes lightly, smiled, and opened the unlocked window a crack."
," Cool outside air flowed in, making the curtains flutter."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Let us put it in the toxin-filled words of a human. ......We are not supposed to exist on this island. I shall go further. 'Right now, there is no one in this corridor'. And yet, the lock has been undone, ......and the window has opened. ......Can you see how great a miracle, a work of magic, ......a proof of our existence that is? Even you should understand the coolness of this breeze..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......I do understand. It's nice and cool..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The coolness, the softness of the breeze. ......And the feel of the fluttering curtain touching your hair. ...All of these things show that we truly are here."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, ......by unlocking the window like this, we can leave behind proof that we really did exist."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......And that is why I unlocked it."""
,"Of course, it wasn't just small pranks like opening a window."
,......She could also smash windows and vases or leave behind strange fires and mysterious scribbles.
," In fact, one time, she actually did play a large-scale prank in the kitchen, piling up kitchenware in an eerie manner and leaving behind a bizarre scribble, which scared the servants considerably."
, It had been a complete success.
," It had been truly terrifying, and she had succeeded in making the servants acknowledge the existence of magic, weakening the anti-magic toxin..."
," However, she chose to make her presence known by unlocking windows."
," By doing this, ......she could release herself from the restrictions imposed by the humans' toxin."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""One day, I will, ...no, we will become a single witch and control all of Rokkenjima. ......When that time comes, we will gain complete freedom and will be capable of stretching our wings as we please."""
,We won't have to be afraid of anyone's gaze anymore.
," We'll be able to fly wherever we wish, disappear whenever we want. Laugh however we like, prank however we like, talk with anyone we want to."
, Humans might ask things of us from time to time. They might fight with us or play with us too.
," What wonderful things for us frail creatures, who cannot appear before anyone, to look forward to......"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Right now, they are little more than pranks. However, as they pile up, proof that we exist will begin to gather. The servants already call me the witch Beatrice, master of the night, and are beginning to believe in me bit by bit."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""The more they believe, the more those humans will lose their anti-magic toxin..."""
,"......I see... So, this means that Father has no anti-magic toxin."
," And, .........that's because he truly believes in the existence of the witch I am, without any doubts."
," I finally realize that, though I'd thought him to be cold, Father did possess a kindness that couldn't be seen......"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'd like to become a great witch and appear in front of everyone soon."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Yes. Eventually, we will be able to appear openly in front of anyone. By doing that repeatedly, we will make people believe in us, ...and eventually, we shall display even our magic for all to see. ......After that happens, we will descend upon Rokkenjima as the great witch you told me of. Ahahahahaha!"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""......The logic of the witch side is very interesting. It keeps me entertained."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It does sound credible, in a way. When humans are frightened to hear that they've entered a ghost hot-spot, they're likely to start yelling 'ghost, ghost!' at the drop of a hat."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""That's right. All phenomena are fundamentally neutral, indifferent, and dull. ......If one wishes to have them be accepted in a certain manner, they must first create a suitable environment..."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""If a person has charisma, people will interpret what they do in a positive way, even when they screw up. ......I see. I guess in that sense, the Beatos' small efforts aren't for nothing."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""If it was just the mansion's locks being undone, everything could be resolved by saying that someone forgot to lock up or that it was some kind of prank. ......However, the rumors of a witch wandering about the mansion night after night slowly began to take shape as the existence of the witch."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""An environment was established so that, if anything strange happened in the mansion at night, it would all be viewed as the work of the witch. ......I get it. If you follow that reasoning to an extreme, it means the same thing as a witch existing in the mansion at night."""
,"After the Beatos finished their mischief of unlocking and opening the window, they enjoyed the coolness of the wind and the brightness of the moon, then became gold butterflies and disappeared into the darkness."
,......There was no way of knowing whether the window they had opened had actually been opened by them.
," The servants might have forgotten to lock up, or one of the family might have opened it after the servants had locked up and forgotten to shut it again, or maybe someone had played a prank."
," In the same way that none of those possibilities could be denied, ......it was also impossible to deny the possibility that a witch really had opened a window to enjoy the night breeze......"
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........A result without an observer can possess an endless number of ways in which it might have occurred. ...Humans, who can't grasp anything more than a single possibility, are unable to imagine anything."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""However, people who believe in the possibility of a witch can imagine that it was a witch's prank. ......When that happens, the scene of the Beatrices' prank that we have just seen is etched into the Fragment as a fact..."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......That's one of the foundations of magic. Decorating...the process."""
,"With just a little magic, even a mass-produced stuffed animal......can be reborn as a wonderful, unique stuffed animal filled with a mother's love."
," If you doubt it, ......it will be burnt by the anti-magic toxin. If you believe it, the magic will become the truth."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""........................Not all magic is bad. ......Maria onee-chan was right. ......Good magic exists too."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""The power to repel evil magic may be necessary for a child of man. However, it is the nature of love in the human world that it does not burn away and defile love-filled magic."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""..................Well, good magic is the only kind I can forgive. ......For all other kinds, the best remedy is to deny them and burn them away."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Heheheheheheheh... A typical answer for a child of man."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Getting back to the point. ......Knowing this much, I guess this means that the ghost Beatrice, who was called the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, doesn't really exist. It's nothing more than a general term for any inexplicable occurrences that took place in the mansion at night. In other words, Beatrice isn't the name of a person, it's the name of a phenomenon."""
,"If anything bizarre happens, it all becomes the work of the Golden Witch..."
, That 'environment in which a witch could exist' is what Beatrice is.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......That all piles up until we reach 1986. ......This is the veil that the true culprit is hiding behind. And the person hiding behind it is, without a doubt, a human."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Let us say that this holds true at this point in the witches' tale of the past. ......However, I doubt you can use that argument alone to fight all the way through 1986, don't you......?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".................."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Heheheheheheheheh......"""
Furudo Erika,"""Ridiculous. Wasn't that obviously because someone forgot to lock up?"""
Shannon,"""W, ......well, you may say that, but...umm... B, but this isn't just something that happened once or twice..."""
Furudo Erika,"""In other words, you're a klutz, a fool, and a moron of a servant who forgot to check not just once or twice, but many times over?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""......Shannon isn't the only one. That same window was always opened even when other servants did the rounds."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Yeah, Mom even asked me if I'd ever left a window open in the hall at night. I had absolutely nothing to do with it, but she still got pissed. Sheesh."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I'm sure Beatrice wanted to gaze at the moon. Uu-."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It is a bit creepy to have that happen over and over at the same window. ......And that time where the kitchenware was piled up in the kitchen, with a creepy magic circle scribbled there...that sounds even more freaky."""
Shannon,"""......Y, yes. They said it was an eerie magic circle drawn with something like blood...... Ever since then, people have been scared to patrol the kitchen..."""
Furudo Erika,"""About the case of the eerie magic circle in the kitchen. Who witnessed that?"""
Shannon,"""Well, ......uh, ......it wasn't me... I, uh......think I heard about it from a servant kid who quit. I wasn't on duty that day..."""
Furudo Erika,"""So, it's basically like this. Just like how the story of some popular haunted location is exaggerated, you servants like to have a little fun telling ghost stories about the mansion at night, right? By doing that, you speak as though the witch exists and infect others with that belief."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......So, all of the eerie things that are supposedly done by Beatrice are baseless rumors, which are either the result of coincidence and accident or something that someone fabricated for fun. ...Is that what you're trying to say?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Exactly. Of course there's no way Beatrice exists."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-...... Beatrice exists."""
Furudo Erika,"""I'm glad you understand so well, Battler-san. ......There's probably some person by that name, or else multiple persons of known or unknown number who take actions to support that claim. "
Furudo Erika,"However, this delusion of a Golden Witch Beatrice that we're all thinking of is completely impossible."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-!! Uu-uu-uu-!! Beatrice exists! I've met her!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Ooh, could you tell me about that in detail? You met Beatrice? And did she show you magic or something?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uu-! I see her all the time! Every time I come to Rokkenjima! And she always shows me fun magic!!"""
,Denying the existence of the witch would always have the immediate effect of infuriating Maria.
," However, Erika, who didn't know to avoid this topic, had challenged her head on."
," But no matter how Maria tried to smooth over the matter of Beatrice's existence, she stood no chance of defeating the ruthlessly intelligent Erika in an argument..."
," George and Jessica hurried to calm Maria down, but Maria's anger could not be settled by this point."
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>! So, she showed you magic? Could you explain in detail what kind of magic?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""She would always use magic to give me candy as a present!! Beato can create candy with magic!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""She just took it out of her pocket, didn't she?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""No, she didn't!! It was magic! It was incredible!! Tons of candies poured out of an empty cup!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""W, wow, that's some awesome magic..."""
Ushiromiya George,"""That's right, that really would be magic...!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Yeah, it was magic!! It really was empty!! I checked inside it myself!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Huh? What do you mean, you checked inside it?"""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""G, give it a rest, Erika-san... She's just a kid..."""
Shannon,"""Anyway, Erika-sama, ...would you like some more t-...kyah-"""
Furudo Erika,"""<No thank you>. I'm having a seriously intellectual discussion over here. You outsiders can stay out of this! "
Furudo Erika,"You'll have to tell me in more detail, Maria-san. What do you mean when you say that you checked inside it? Fortunately, we have right here with us a tea cup that's just been overturned and emptied! Come on, be my guest and reenact what happened then, okay?! Let's see it, if you would, let's see it!!"""
,"After holding the cup of black tea, which she had just overturned and was still dripping, upside down over the table, Erika slammed it down hard and slid it over to Maria."
," Erika's eyes glowed repulsively, like those of a snake about to snap up a frog."
, Those eyes were ice-cold and had a madness in them that made one want to avert their gaze.
," On the other hand, Maria was glaring furiously, her whole body shaking uncontrollably, in the greatest expression of anger that a human can manage."
, The look on her face was frightening...not at all something one would expect to see on a nine year old girl.
Shannon,"""S, stop it, both of you...!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Uuu--!!! Okay!! So Beatrice took the empty cup!! Then she did this!! And she put it upside down on the table!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Yes, and then what?! Did she then lift it up and candies flowed out?! Incredible, that really would be magic, right? ...It *would* be!!!"""
,"Battler and the others tried to get between the two and calm them down, but it was no use."
," The two violently pushed aside the others, and, glaring at each other from so close that their foreheads banged together, they repeatedly slammed down the upside down cup on the table."
, The sound of their foreheads banging together and the cup being slapped down...shattered the barrier between reality and illusion...!!
Ushiromiya Maria,"""It is magic, it is magic!! Beato used magic to make candies appear!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Then why don't you reproduce it for us?!! Founder of Mariage Sorciere, MARIA, the Witch of Origiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinsss!!"""
Dlanor,"""Lady Erika, this opponent is not worth your TIME. This battle is not worth FIGHTING..."""
Furudo Erika,"""Shut up, murder doll!! Alright!! How do you claim that the overturned cup was filled with candies?!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Just turning the cup over won't make candies come out!! Because you have to use magic to make them come out!! Beato can use magic because she's a witch!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Oh yes, magic, she used magic!! How did she use magic?! Did she swing a magic wand and tap the cup to make candies pour out?! *giggle*, no, that can't be it, right? Right?!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Beato is a witch so she used magic! Magic is when you say an incantation and cause a miracle!! You can't use the magic that makes candy unless you say the incantation!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Oh, sure, understood. <Good>, <good>, very <good>!! Let's see this incantation, let's see this magic, come on, what kind of incantation would a witch use? What kind?!?!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Come, try and picture it!! The inside of the cup is filled with candies!! Try and picture such a wonder!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Ooooooooooh? And then whaaaaaaat?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Look, the inside of the cup......is filled with candy!!!"""
,"Maria grasped the overturned cup so tightly that it nearly cracked, ......and slowly......lifted it up..."
," Then, ......from the inside, ......several cute candies poured out...! "
,"Maria looked at Erika with a full smile, as though saying 'that showed you'."
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>!! Is this what you call Beatrice's magic?! Dlanoooooooooor!!"
Furudo Erika," Beat  her  to  death !!!"""
Dlanor,"""........................As you WISH."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I won't let anyone deny Beato's magic!! After all, magic is magic!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Magic is impossible. {p:2:You might be telling a lie about something that never happened!!}"""
Dlanor,"""Repetition DEMANDED. Failure to respond will be a violation of Knox's 7th."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Ahahaha, I'll respond! This is the truth!! {p:1:This story really happened!!}"""
Furudo Erika,"""{p:2:This wouldn't have anything to do with a trick in the actual cup or table, making this just a sleight of hand, right? }That would be against the rules, wouldn't it?!?!"""
Dlanor,"""Hidden devices and tricks are in violation of Knox's 3rd. However, if and only if foreshadowing has been presented, these are permitted by Knox's 8th."""
,Knox's 3rd prohibits hidden doors and devices that have no clues pointing towards them.
," However, by presenting foreshadowing and clues that point towards the existence of said devices, Knox's 8th allows them to be used."
Ushiromiya Maria,"""{p:1:They had no such tricks in them!! It was just an ordinary table and an ordinary cup!! }That's why it's magic, not sleight of hand!!"""
Dlanor,"""......UNDERSTOOD. ......By Knox's 9th, we acknowledge that Lady MARIA witnessed MAGIC."""
Furudo Erika,"""Ahahahahahahahahaha!! That's right, with the 9th at least!! Observers are always allowed to speak their personal opinions! "
Furudo Erika,"Otherwise, mysteries where the culprit is seen dressed up as a woman and it's written 'I saw a woman' would all be disqualified!! Sure, that's fine, claim that you saw magic all you want!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""All truths are nothing more than claims! So, I'll make a claim separate from yours and smash right through yours!! That is the detective's duty, and the time we shine the mooooooost!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""You can't break through this, this is magic!!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Since it is magic, only witches can use it, right?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""That's right, only witches can use it!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""...So, if a human like me could use it too, that would mean it isn't magic, right?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""You can't use it!!! Only Beato can use magic!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>!! Then why don't I show you?!! I'll make candy appear from out of this empty cup!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""If you think you can, just try!! Impossible, impossible, useless, useless! There's no way a human can do it!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Then please, please, please just relax and watch!! Okay, here we have an empty cup. Is that okay? It is, isn't it? Then we turn it over on the table like this!!"""
Gertrude,"""......Let it be known that this fight has no point..."""
Dlanor,"""............"""
Furudo Erika,"""Okay, can you say the incantation for creating candies? In fact, why don't we say it together? Come, try and picture it!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""The inside of the cup is filled with candy!! Try and picture such a wonder!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""<Stooop>!! Maria-san. Why do you close your eyes when you say the incantation? Why not witness the miracle of magic?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Humans are stained by the anti-magic toxin!! If a lowly human saw it, the miracle of magic would be wiped out of existence!! That's why there's a rule that says lowly humans have to close their eyes when using magic!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""I see, I see. Okay, I understand the protocol used by humans performing magic!! In other words, not once have you ever witnessed the moment the magic happened! Isn't that right?!"
Furudo Erika," Look, it's done! Please, try and lift up the cup, okay...? After all, I've used the magic to make candies appear."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""There's no way someone who makes fun of witches could use the candy magic...!"""
Furudo Erika,"""But if it actually did work, all the better."""
,"After glaring at Erika with the utmost of malice, ......Maria slowly stretched her hand out towards the overturned cup..."
,"......There was no way that Erika, someone who made fun of witches like this, could ever use magic."
, There was no way that there'd be candy there...
Furudo Erika,"""............So, how's it look inside?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,""".....................Ah-"""
,......And there......lay a single...candy with a cute wrapper......
Furudo Erika,""".........See?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""............"""
Furudo Erika,"""......This is magic, right?"""
,Erika smiled gently......
, A look of disbelieving shock rose in Maria's eyes......along with envy for this person who could use the same magic as Beato...
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Erika.........you can...use magic too...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""See? It's magic, isn't it? What I did there."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Y, ............yeah!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""So, in other words-"""
,Erika smiled pleasantly. ......She and Maria had finally reached a deep understanding...
Furudo Erika,"""You're a morooooooooooooon!!! "" "
Furudo Erika,"{p:2:While you had your eyes closed, I just lifted the cup up and tossed a candy in!! Call that magic? It's just a third-rate triiiiiick, hyahhaaaaaaah!!! "
Furudo Erika,"There's my blue truth as the detective. Now, as the Witch of Truth, here's my red truuuuuuuuuuth!!!"""
Furudo Erika,{p:1:Your so-called candy magic is nothing more than a sleight of hand!!{p:1:Just a sleight of hand that the fake witch calling herself Beatrice or whatever claimed was magic!! 
Furudo Erika,"I mean, seriously, did you really get tricked by such a stupid sleight of hand? The magic that your perspective speaks of is completely untrustworthy!!!"
Furudo Erika,"""{p:2:Everything that you ever thought was magic was just a trick that you didn't get!! There's no way it was magic! There's no way magic exiiiiiiiiiiiiiists!!}"""
Furudo Erika,"""......Huuuh?!"""
Sakutarou,"""{p:2:P, putting the candy in this cup might have been your sleight of hand, but that doesn't prove that Beato's magic was also a sleight of hand.} Uryuuu--!!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""{p:2:However, you also can't prove that it could only have been done with magic!! You rotten stuffed animaaaal!!}"""
Gertrude,"""......Please, allow me to speak."""
Cornelia,"""Know that this is a meaningless battle."""
Furudo Erika,"""You damn scraps of paper!! Why'd you have to butt in at the good part...?!!"""
Dlanor,"""That is ENOUGH. Lady MARIA has been shown that the magic which makes candy appear in a cup could possibly be a trick that she misunderstood to be MAGIC. Therefore, her claim that it was magic is DISMISSED."""
Sakutarou,"""{p:2:However, it might really have been magic when Maria saw it...! Just because it can be done by a sleight of hand doesn't disprove magic.}"""
Dlanor,"""......Well done, Lady Erika. Congratulations on crushing Lady MARIA's Illusion of the WITCH."""
,The Illusion of the Witch is created by making the existence of magic be acknowledged by claiming that it would be impossible without magic. That is the attack used by witches.
," If someone can argue back and say that it would be possible without magic, the Illusion of the Witch is defeated, and the witch must retreat."
," The magic that Maria claimed to have seen had the possibility of being a trick, so it was unqualified to be acknowledged as magic."
," That was only the result of this battle. It was still too early to bring the fight into the domain of denying Beatrice, the witch and the magic that Maria believed in......"
," However, battles will always end instantly when your opponent surrenders."
," Erika had wanted to hit Maria with everything at once, defiling the witch and magic she believed in and crushing it without a fragment of compassion..."
Furudo Erika,"""..................Sheesh!! Just one more step and I'd have been able to take a heart as innocent as the smooth sand just after a wave has pulled back...and tear it to bits. .........What a shame. This isn't any fun anymore. ............Are you satisfied now?! Ouch, ...owowowow......"""
,"Erika grumpily punched Dlanor's arm that had been restraining her. However, that cold, hard, marble-like arm just made Erika's hand hurt."
Sakutarou,""".........D, diplomatic immunity...! This battle is over...!"""
Gertrude,"""Allow me to speak. Diplomatic immunity accepted."""
Cornelia,"""......Know that this fight is childish."""
Furudo Erika,"""Did you say something?!"""
Dlanor,"""She did NOT. ......Let us WITHDRAW. Lady MARIA is no enemy of yours, Lady Erika. There is no need to pay any attention to small fry such as THIS."""
Furudo Erika,"""............Hmph. ......You're right. How childish of me, tearing a kid's dreams apart. I'm really sorry, okay? I apologize for my momentary lack of elegance. *giggle*giggle*. Let's go."""
,"Erika's group turned their backs on Maria, who was still crouching down limply."
," However, ......as detectives in famous mysteries have always done in the past, Erika clapped her hands, stopped, and turned around."
Furudo Erika,"""Oh, that's right. ......What do you think...?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""............?"""
Furudo Erika,"""Simply by the existence of the overturned cup, this level of reasoning was possible for Furudo Erika. .........What do you think, everyone?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,""".........!"""
,Erika's merciless words gouged themselves into Maria's heart once more......
Furudo Erika,"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahaahahahahhaahaha!!! "
,"Erika left, leaving an evil laugh behind her."
," After bowing to Maria and Sakutarou, Dlanor left too."
,......Gertrude and Cornelia followed suit...
," After that, only Maria and Sakutarou were left in the lonely Golden Land......"
Sakutarou,"""............Uryuu-......"""

Sakutarou,"""Uryu... Beato is a witch..."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""It was magic............*hic*......it was magic......"""
Sakutarou,"""It was magic... Beato used magic to give you candy... You don't need to doubt that... ......Uryuu-...! Please believe in Beato... You know that magic can't bear fruit unless you believe..."""

,"In the middle of an ice-cold drizzle, which had started falling at some point, ......Maria sobbed..."
," Trying to at least protect her from the rain, Sakutarou used his large sleeves to cover Maria's head......and stayed there by her side......"
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Okay, let's go, Maria...! Let's play cards together in the room upstairs..."""
Ushiromiya George,"""......Erika-san. As an adult, I cannot condone that conversation just now."""
Furudo Erika,"""My apologies. I'm still just a kid, after all."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......*hic*, .........*hic*......"""
,"After seeing that wonderful candy magic brutally insulted by Erika, ......Maria had been crying this whole time..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Haah... ......I started noticing it at the quiz party after dinner, but your personality is screwed up. ......Do you think this is fun?! Do you like tearing a little kid's dreams apart?"""
Shannon,"""P, please stop, Battler-sama...! Please, for my sake, don't push any further here...! Please...!"""
,"Shannon, who had been looking flustered, bowed her head deeply and implored Battler to stop. George, who didn't want Shannon pressured, fell in line."
Ushiromiya George,"""Let's go. Let's spend this year in the cousins' room too. We can watch TV and play cards."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""......I've heard that Erika-san has her own room. Shannon, please guide her."""
Furudo Erika,"""Oh, no need to bother yet. I'll relax down here for a little while longer. I want to savor it a bit."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......What the hell are you trying to savor......pft."""
,Battler and the others could no longer hide their irritation.
, They had no obligation to entertain their uninvited guest any further than this.
, Erika herself understood perfectly well that no place would welcome a detective.
," Battler and the others wanted to leave, and Erika wanted to stay. Neither had any desire to stop the other."
," Jessica urged Maria, who was still crying, to come along..."
," Then, Maria stopped and spun around."
Furudo Erika,""".........Got a problem?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!! They do exist here and there...humans that are practically lumps of the toxin that doesn't believe in magic! There were many boys like you in my class!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""They don't believe in witches, or magic, or miracles, or happiness! You can't become a witch if you let the toxin of people like that burn you to ashes! I may not look it, but I'm Beatrice's disciple! I'm the Apprentice Witch of Origins! Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!!"""
,"Maria, who had been sobbing until a second ago, seemed to have been transformed into an entirely different person. ......She laughed...no, cackled eerily."
," Battler's group stiffened up at this sudden change, but Erika was watching calmly."
," Then, she smiled and gave a small nod in response."
Furudo Erika,"""<Good>. ......You've got some guts. Goodnight, <Miss> MARIA. Let's fight in a more satisfying game next time."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Sure, let's. It's a promise. ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihi."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Y, you stop that too, Maria...! Come on, let's go."""
Ushiromiya George,"""What about you, Shannon-chan? You can play cards with us, if you want."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Come on, join us for at least one round. It'll cheer you up."""
Shannon,"""Uh, ......ah...th, then, just for a bit......"""
,Shannon couldn't remain in this suffocating lounge any longer either.
," In part apologetic and in part trying to escape, she followed after Battler's group..."
," After that, Erika was the only one left in the lounge..."
," Still wearing a thin smile, she tapped a glass with her finger."
, There was a light *chink*.......A surprisingly boring sound.
," Even so, Erika wore a thin smile, as though pleased..."
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohoho, sorry to keep you waiting. I was just in the bath... ......Oh, where is everyone?"""
Furudo Erika,"""......You just missed them. They went up to the second floor. I'm the one who called you here. ......I've heard that you know a lot about the story of Akujikishima and the story of the witch of the forest."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Yes, well. Hohoho. It is a trivial story, but..."""
Furudo Erika,"""I don't mind in the slightest if it's trivial. Would you like a drink to follow your bath? "
Furudo Erika,"......Even I like to be helpful every now and then."""
,"Erika stood up, opened the refrigerator behind the counter, and put ice into the ice pail......"
