Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The day after Christmas isn't Christmas. It couldn't happen."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Heheheh. Too bad. Wrong."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? Why...?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ange-chan, what time of day does a new day start?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Midnight, at 12:00 AM."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""There you go. Isn't it nighttime at midnight?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Ah."""
,I see. The first night was just after midnight on December 25th.
," In other words, the time right after the previous day ended and Christmas began."
," That would indeed be Christmas Day, and it would be at night."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""And then, the morning of the 25th would come, and when the sun sank again, that would be nighttime on the 25th again......"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Exactly! You figured it out."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hohoho! If only you had figured it out a little faster."""
,Grandfather laughed like Santa Claus.
," Eva oba-san asked him to count it as a right answer, since I figured it out in the end, but Grandfather shook his head."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Come on...! Don't be such a stingy Grandpa."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Still, now I've figured out how to do it. I'll get the next one right."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Yes, yes. That's the spirit. That's my granddaughter for you."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thank you, Grandpa! I'm really ready now. I'll start getting a lot of them right!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Yes. Give it your all. I have a truly splendid present waiting for you."""
,"After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Eva oba-san to where everyone else was gathered."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Oh, I see. It is possible...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yep, that's right. After all, there are two nights in every day."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Right! December 25th starts at 12:00 midnight. Midnight is during the night, so that's the first night. Then, morning comes, and when night falls again, it's still the same day until midnight!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Exactly. And both of those nights are nights on Christmas Day."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Eheheheheh. Am I awesome? Am I awesome...?!"""
,"With a delighted smile, Eva oba-san patted my head vigorously."
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahahaha! Well done, Ange. I tried to make it a hard question, but you solved it like it was nothing."""
Ronoue Genji,"""Congratulations, Ange-sama. ......Here is a medal for getting the first question right."""
,"Genji-san held out a gold-colored medal. Grandfather smiled at me, urging me to take it."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Th, thank you!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Keep up the pace. Well now, that is all for my puzzle. Head over there and ask whomever you choose for a quiz."""
,"It was a heavy, gold-colored medal."
," If I get a lot of these right, my pocket might burst."
, I'm gonna get so many that I can brag about it to everyone! 
,"After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Eva oba-san to where everyone else was gathered."
, Kinzo watched Ange go  a warm gaze.
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Did I make it a bit too easy...?"""
Ronoue Genji,"""No. I think it was just right."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........Genji. Have I...managed to act the part of a good grandpa...?"""
Ronoue Genji,"""Of course."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Ange is young. And, she frequently grows sick and is unable to come to Rokkenjima. ......She probably won't...remember me well."""
,Young children have their own kind of cruelty.
, They think of kindness as something they will naturally receive.
," And because they think of kindness as only natural, ......they forget about it quickly."
Ronoue Genji,"""......It is no different from gratitude to one's parents. It will probably take Ange-sama many years before she understands."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Do you think......that she will eventually remember that I was a fun grandpa?"""
Ronoue Genji,"""......Yes. I am certain of it."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".................."""
,Kinzo's expression grew slightly darker.
,"......Eventually, even Ange will get older, and she will probably hear how the public at large regards Ushiromiya Kinzo."
, The Ushiromiya Kinzo known by the public is completely different from the Kinzo who plays with his grandchildren.
," When she learns, ......will Ange remember the face of Kinzo the tyrant, known of by the world, ...or that gently smiling face?"
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......If possible, I would hope for her to remember my smile, ......but such a thing is probably too much to ask for."""
Ronoue Genji,"""............"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""There's no way around it. That's what children are."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oh, it's you."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Children just eat up kindness, and it never remains in their memories. By the time 12 years have passed, she will surely learn what a bizarre eccentric Ushiromiya Kinzo was. Your smile is fated to be painted over by that and forgotten."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Most probably. No matter how much I spoil her, my love will not be rewarded."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However, just as it takes a long time to remember what you owe your parents, ......Ange will surely remember someday. ......She will remember the smiles you showed her."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hmph...... Let her forget. One smile from her is the greatest parting gift I could ever take with me, when my time comes. This is...the essence of unrewarded love."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I guess grandfathers are always unrewarded."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oh, but I have been rewarded. With Ange's smile just now to look back upon, I could happily pass on in my sleep tonight. Wahhahahahahahahaha......"""
,"With a lonely laugh, Kinzo spun around, setting his cape fluttering."
, This was all the love he could offer Ange as a grandfather.
," Part of him wanted to be remembered, but he knew he mustn't wish for that."
, That was...how unrewarded love worked.
," After looking at Kinzo's back, Beato stared at Ange's back again."
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........Ange. ......Even so, please remember it someday. ......Remember the smile...that Kinzo once showed you."""
,"Okay, whose quiz should I take next? "
,"I'm gonna challenge more and more people, get more and more medals for getting them right, and get a wonderful present to show everyone."
, Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san are over there.
, They're looking this way and smiling. I'm sure they've thought up some interesting puzzles.
," There's Hideyoshi oji-san, beckoning for me to come over."
," He's a fun uncle, so I'm sure he's thought up a fun question."
," Mom and Dad are across from him. They're waving at me, telling me to have lots of fun."
,......Dad probably knows a lot of really hard questions. He might be tough.
," Over there is Rosa oba-san and Maria onee-chan. It looks like they're reading a quiz book together, searching for a problem."
," Every now and then, Maria onee-chan glances over at me, saying 'kihihihihi'."
," She can be mean sometimes, so I'm sure her puzzle won't be a nice one."
," Beyond them are Battler onii-chan, George onii-chan, and Jessica onee-chan."
,"......Battler onii-chan is usually nice, but he sometimes says really mean things, and I think he likes seeing me get confused."
,......I get the feeling... that he'll give me a really tough problem.
, Is there anyone who looks like they won't be mean? 
,"If I can, I'd like to start with some easy puzzles to warm me up."
, All the way over there are Genji-san and Doctor Nanjo. I don't think those two will be mean to me.
, And then there's Shannon and Kanon.
, Shannon knows about a lot of quizzes and fairy tales. I'm sure she'll give me something unique.
," Then, we have Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, who are serving tea."
, Kumasawa-san might be tough. ......I kinda think she'll give me a really confusing problem.
,......It looks like everyone might be pretty tough. Hmmmmm......
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Ange-chan. I've got a good one for ya...! Over here!"""
,Hideyoshi oji-san is calling for me.......What should I do? Should I go?
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Do you want to try Hideyoshi oji-san?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. The order doesn't matter. After all, I'm gonna challenge everyone."""
,I rolled up my sleeves and headed towards Hideyoshi oji-san.
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahahahahahaha, here you are. Mine's a tricky one, okay?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I wonder what sort of question you'll give her. Don't make it too hard, okay?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's okay if it's hard. I'll solve it."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Oooh, looking pretty confident there...! Okay, here it comes!"""
,"After clearing his throat, Hideyoshi oji-san started telling his question..."
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Mine's a riddle. Listen closely, now. You know the story of Momotarou, right?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The boy who floated down a river in a peach?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right. But you know, one day, an apple floated down that river."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""An apple??"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Yep! And the next day, a butternut squash floated down it!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I hate butternut squash."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""And then, the next day, some cabbage floated down it! And the next day, a dill pickle did. And the next day, an eggplant floated by. And the day after that, a fig did!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*giggle*. What a strange tale. Did a greengrocer live upstream, or something?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Okay, here's the question. What floated down the river the next day?!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh...?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I've got it. Do you get it, Ange-chan?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't get it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Then I'll give you a hint. There's a pattern to the things that float down the river. Can you guess what the pattern is?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahahahaha! What a huge hint...!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........I don't...have a clue!"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahhahahahahahahaha. Guess that was a bit too hard...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I know what floated down the river the day after that. A hassaku orange, right?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Yep. And the day after that, it was probably an i.........i...hmmm... ......I can't think of a veggie that starts with 'i'!"""
,"I'm not sure I understand. No, I don't even have a clue."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I know! It's a grapefruit!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. It wasn't one of the choices, but green beans would have worked too."""
,The names all followed the alphabet. Apple was 'a'. Butternut squash was 'b'. Cabbage was 'c'.
," It kept going with 'd', 'e', and 'f'."
," So, after 'f' comes 'g'. That's why the answer had to be something that started with 'g'."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thanks, Eva oba-san. I got it right thanks to your hint!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*giggle*. You solved it by yourself, Ange-chan. Incredible."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Yep, nice work! Now, here's your medal for gettin' it right...!"""
,Hideyoshi took out a gold-colored medal and placed it on my palm.
," It felt heavy in my hand. Yeah, this is what victory feels like."
, I'd better keep it up!
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""I've got another medal for Eva's puzzle. But I can't think of any more."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Then maybe I should give Ange-chan a puzzle."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? You will?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Sure. A quiz for the princess from her attendant♪ I've thought of a fun one, so please, have a go at it!"""
,Eva oba-san smiled brightly.
," I want to get as many medals as possible, so of course, I want as many chances as I can get."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay, I'll have a go at it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*giggle*. That's the spirit. Okay, here it comes."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We've talked about how I love to travel, haven't we?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. You said you like traveling overseas a lot."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. So this will be a puzzle about traveling. There was a traveler in a certain place."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""A traveler?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""First, the traveler walked five kilometers north."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Should I write this down on a piece of paper?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Don't worry. The puzzle isn't that hard, so listening to it will be enough."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The traveler first walked five kilometers north. Then, he walked five kilometers to the east. Then, he walked five kilometers to the south."""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Five kilometers north. Five kilometers east. Five kilometers south. ......You mean, like a blocky 'n'?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""That's right! You work it out, and he's in a spot five kilometers to the east of where he started."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That should be the case, right? But, incredibly, this traveler ended up in the exact same spot he started. ......Is something so mysterious possible?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahaha, there's no way! His compass must've gone crazy."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Of course it didn't! Eheheheheh, do you know, Ange-chan?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It wasn't because of his compass? ......Is this a play on words?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""No, this is a real quiz. For a hint, why don't you try thinking about a globe?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............I don't get it."""
,I've never traveled overseas at all.
, There might be some strange place in the world where you could walk in a blocky 'n' and get back to where you started.
,"......Like the Bermuda Triangle, or something..."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Hmmm...... I guess that was a bit too hard for you, Ange-chan."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""If you went north, then east, then south, there's no way you'd get back to where you started."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But there is a place. A place somewhere on the Earth's surface. If you have a globe in your house, take a good look at it and think carefully. If you just can't figure it out, try asking your dad, okay?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay, I'll ask him. So tell me the right answer...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*giggle*. The right answer is a ve~ry cold place. Where can you find cold places on a globe? Think about it carefully. Once you figure it out, you can try giving this quiz to the other kids in your class. I'm sure they'll all be surprised."""
,Where can you find a cold place? ......Hokkaido? 
,"I don't think you end up at the start if you go north, east, then south in Hokkaido."
,......Nnnn. I don't get it. I give up.
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Okay, that's all for our puzzles! Go ask one of the others to give you one!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Let's go! Who should we challenge next?!"""
,"If Eva oba-san knows puzzles this hard, I'm sure she must be good at quizzes."
," If she's with me, I know we'll get lots and lots of medals."
, Who will I ask next...?!
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I got it...! It's a really cold place! Yeah, it must be incredibly cold there!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Perfect! Ange-chan, you must really be a genius, to get something like that at your age."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""If you start at the south pole, then after you go north, going east just draws a circle around the south pole. So, anytime you go south again, that just takes you right back to the south pole."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I tried to make it an extra hard puzzle, but Ange-chan was just too good."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Congrats! Here's another medal for ya."""
,"I got a heavy, gold-colored medal."
," All right, I did it...! Eva oba-san and I held up our fists in celebration."
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Okay, that's all for our puzzles! Go ask one of the others to give you one!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay! Thank you, Hideyoshi oji-san...!"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Your aunt's really clever...! ......With the two of you together, you'll be gettin' medals right and left!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yep, that's right!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Let's do our best together, Eva oba-san."""
,I dashed away. Who will I ask next...?! 
,"Hideyoshi oji-san waved goodbye, smiling......"
," Hideyoshi and Eva watched as Ange ran off happily, looking for the next quiz."
Ushiromiya Eva,""".........Even though that kid can wear such a cute smile... ...I will......be the one who takes that away from her..."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Eva........."""
,Eva hung her head. A single tear sparkled in her eye...
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Her reaction was only natural, considering how she felt. ......But I...wasn't able to see past it and accept her feelings......"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""It can't be helped. You're as human as anyone else. Humans tend to be more fragile than you'd think."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Even so, it was my fault...! After all, I already had the experience of bringing up a child, right?! ......I should have become her mother. ......And yet, I let sadness overwhelm me, ......and I didn't do it at all..."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""It can't be helped, I tell you...! Don't think you were the only one at fault...! You shouldn't blame yourself so much!"""
,"By now, Eva was unable to hold back her sobs... Large tears dripped down her cheeks as she stared at the ground and shook..."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What a sin I've committed...... ......My sadness was no greater than hers...! And yet, I decided that I was suffering the most, ......so I didn't accept her feelings...... ......I'm a failure of a mother... I wasn't able......to become a mother for her......"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""That's wrong. ......You did your best for her, Eva nee-san."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Kyrie-san..."""
,Kyrie and Rudolf were standing behind Eva now.
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""I know the lengths you went to...to keep the truth from Ange."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......You held out well, Aneki. Guess that daughter of ours really has been a pain, clueless about how much you suffered."""
,After the accident on Rokkenjima...
," Eva, the only one who left Rokkenjima alive, adopted Ange, the girl who had been absent and survived."
,"......While they would eventually develop a sad and mutually painful relationship, it wasn't like that at first."
," Eva tried to show affection for Ange, her last remaining blood relative. She tried to become Ange's new mother. Even as she fought back the sadness she herself felt."
," However, Ange wasn't able to accept that kindness. She lashed out at Eva, the only one who had returned alive, for stealing her parents away from her."
,"......Eva, understanding the wounds that this little six-year-old girl bore, withstood these attacks. She grit her teeth and poured all of her affection onto Ange...affection that went ignored."
," However, ......the wounds Eva herself bore were also extremely deep."
," She was never rewarded for her sad efforts, ......and the future in front of her grew dark."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""You tried to show Ange the same affection you once showed George-kun."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But still, ......that was just for my own satisfaction. ......Ange-chan never felt any of it..."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Ange was the one who couldn't accept it. It isn't your fault."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""But who could possibly ask that of Ange-chan when she was just six years old...?! I should've held out much, much longer, until she could understand my feelings...!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Eva nee-san. I want you to believe one thing."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""............"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""We...don't blame you in the slightest."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Kyrie-san............"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Thank you so much...for suffering so long for Ange's sake...... ......If that kid has a human heart, then I'm sure she'll recognize the affection you showed her someday."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Thank you, Aneki. We'll always be grateful......"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,""".........Isn't that wonderful, Eva...... ......All of your efforts......have been witnessed......"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Uuuuu......uwaaaaaaaahhhh........."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""How are you doing, Ange-sama? If you wish, I, Gohda, would be pleased to challenge you."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohoho. And I, Kumasawa, have a ve~ry tricky puzzle for you."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It doesn't matter how hard it is. I'm not alone. I'll solve it with Eva oba-san!"""
,"Gohda and Kumasawa offered to challenge me. I'll have to go up against everyone in the end, so it doesn't matter who comes next."
," I waved at Eva oba-san to hurry up, and she ran toward me."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""So, we're challenging this pair next? Who will we start with?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay...Gohda-san."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Very well, as you wish. Here is my puzzle."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohohoho. I'll warn you, it's a toughie."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'll still solve it. I've gotten the knack of it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You'd better not underestimate Ange-chan. Right?!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Right!"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""My, my. ...Well then, being the humble chef that I am, here is a puzzle about food and the kitchen."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We'll fight together this time. If you don't get it, just ask me to lend a hand. I'll give you a hint."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......If I get a hint, does that mean I don't get a medal?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It won't affect your medals at all, so feel free to ask away!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I've got it. The hint here...is that the witch got home much later than usual."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......What happens when she gets home later than usual?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Think carefully. The food is always freshly-made and served at the usual time, right? So, ......what happens when she gets home long after that?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I don't get it. Food isn't supposed to talk."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Well, uh, that's because this is a fairy tale puzzle......"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohhohohohohoho... It looks as though she didn't figure it out."""
,"The answer I'd chosen at random was wrong, apparently. ......Too bad."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Then tell me the right answer, Eva oba-san. You figured it out, right? Tell me!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Alright. The answer is-"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Eva-sama, if you wouldn't mind...! They say recipes and riddle answers are best while they remain secret."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You think so...? Eheheh, I'll have to tell her sometime later when you aren't around, then."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah, it's a promise!"""
,"But even if I hear the answer later on, I still got it wrong."
, Oh well. I'd better pull myself together and take a shot at Kumasawa-san's puzzle.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The ice cream! The witch got back really late, so the ice cream would've melted. So she couldn't eat it!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Nicely done! See? Ange-chan is a clever girl, isn't she?"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Congratulations, Ange-sama! Very impressive. How quickly you saw through the puzzle that I, Gohda, put all my efforts into...!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It was totally easy. Eva oba-san's puzzle was harder."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""*giggle*, thanks."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Congratulations. This medal is your prize for answering my question correctly."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thank you!"""
,"Alright, that was easy. Now let's take a shot at Kumasawa-san's puzzle."
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Looks like I'm up next. Now, let's test Ange-sama with my specially-made, super-hard puzzle. Are you ready?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""How... hard is it?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohohohohoho. You'll have to wait and see. And now, let the mackerel dessert puzzle begin."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Mackerel dessert...?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This is Kumasawa-san we're talking about, so you can bet it'll be a strange one. Be careful."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Eva oba-san, do you get it?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""She says you have to change one letter, so the answer's probably some sort of word game. Her choice of words is suspicious to say the least. Try and think of some kind of dessert that you can make by changing a letter in...... Ah, I've got it!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh?! What is it? What is it?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Forget changing a whole letter... You only need to change one line. In fact, that pretty much gives you the answer."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""*bzzzz*. Wro-ng."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh?! I don't get it! I don't get it at all...!"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohohoho, sorry, but wrong is wrong. Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you, Ange-sama."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Come on, Kumasawa-san. That was a nasty puzzle..."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It doesn't make sense! There's no way you could make a dessert out of mackerel! What's the answer? Tell me!"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohoho, it's no fun if I tell you. If you don't guess it quick, ......then you really will be having mackerel for dessert. Ihihihihihihihihihi......"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Tell me, tell me!"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Nope."""
,"Kumasawa smiled cheerily, but remained stubborn. No matter how much I bother her, she probably won't tell me the answer."
Gohda Toshiro,"""That concludes our puzzles. There are probably others waiting for you to challenge them, Ange-sama. Please, on to the next challenge."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""We're both rooting for you, Ange-sama."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay! I'll keep on trying hard and getting more and more medals!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's the spirit. Don't let it get you down. Plenty more chances left!"""
,"We rushed away. Okay, who should we take on next...?!"
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I got it! The letter is 'b'! If you change the 'b' in Saba-ra to an 'h', you get Sahara!"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohohohoho, that's correct."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The last line said you could make a grand 'desert' out of sabara. Not dessert...!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I figured out a trick in Japanese and English! Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You're so smart, Ange-chan! You deserve a pat on the head...!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Haha, I like it when you do that."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Just change a single letter, and even mackerel can make a fine desert. Are you starting to see how omnipotent mackerel is?"""
Gohda Toshiro,"""The day I'm forced to serve a joke like that for dessert, I imagine heads will roll......"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I wouldn't like it either. I like ice cream for dessert."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ahahahahahaha, of course. By the way, we shouldn't be worried, should we? What about tonight's dessert?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Ohohohohoho...... I can hardly wait to surprise everyone with the mackerel fruit parfait waiting there in the kitchen!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Nooooooo!!"""
,Everyone burst out laughing.
," For some time after that, I was tormented by the terrifying image of a parfait neatly topped with mackerel bits..."
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""What a shame...... I tried so hard to stop Ange-sama from getting that prize, but she solved my best riddle like it was nothing."""
,"Though she said that, Kumasawa smiled. A gold-colored medal glittered in her wrinkly hand."
, Ange took it.
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Well then, that's all for our puzzles."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Please keep up the pace, get more and more medals, and win that splendid prize from the Master!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay! Thank you. I'll keep it up...! We did it, Eva oba-san!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Eheheh! Let's keep it up!"""
,"We rushed away. Okay, who should we take on next...?!"
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""It seems that all of a sudden, the tiny girl who used to hide and tremble in Kyrie-sama's shadow... has grown to be so bright and cheery..."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......With each passing family conference, one can feel the growth of those youngsters. After just a few years more, Ange-sama will surely learn of love, of makeup, and will eventually grow to become a true lady."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Very true...... If she grows normally with the passing time, that is..."""
,A cruel fate......forces the chick called Ange into a lonely future.
," If an egg isn't warmed, it won't hatch. The egg she is now will not be warmed by anyone, and it will not hatch..."
Gohda Toshiro,"""Inside that frozen egg, will Ange-sama have no choice but to face that isolated future...?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""......An egg's shell can always be broken from the inside. ......Even if a cold shell is very, very hard, that doesn't mean it cannot be broken."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Does Ange-sama have the strength to do that?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Is she capable of achieving that or not...? I hear that question is what this final game is all about."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""Perhaps we should have sent her a clearer message. ......If the egg cannot be warmed, could we not at least strike it from the outside to make it easier to crack?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""If a chick without the power to break its own shell is forced outside of the egg, it won't be able to withstand the cold winds. Ange-sama will have to find that power and resilience herself."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......But, can we not somehow explain that power and resilience to her?"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Words cannot be given. They can only be accepted. ......No matter what we try to give Ange-sama, it will be meaningless unless she accepts it."""
Gohda Toshiro,""".........You are right. No matter what we try to tell Ange-sama, it won't matter unless she listens."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Hohohoho...... We can do nothing but watch over her. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""We can do nothing......but pray that Ange-sama chooses a better future for herself."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""If Ange-sama does not abandon herself to anger for the sole purpose of distracting herself from her resignation and sadness... If she can just be honest about that one, single wish that she truly desires more than anything else... Then you can be certain that she will make her greatest wish come true."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""It is ironic. ......Since the very beginning, she has been denying that greatest wish of hers herself."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Laughter brings happiness. Tears bring misfortune. Those who believe will be saved. ......People have the power to create their own futures by the strength of their emotions."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""I wish we could just let her hear those words......"""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""Battler-sama is very strict. ......He's hoping that Ange will realize it by her own power alone...and is not permitting even words of this nature to be told to her."""
Gohda Toshiro,"""......It seems we can do nothing but watch over her."""
Kumasawa Chiyo,"""And so, let us pray, at least. Pray that she grasps the world she desires most with her own hands."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Oh, have you selected me?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. I'll have to face everyone sooner or later. Right, Eva oba-san?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Right! Come on, let's have a puzzle. We'll solve it in a flash!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Hahahaha. I see, I see. Then it seems I must make it a good one."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Genji. You should give her one as well. A tough one."""
Ronoue Genji,"""As you wish. ......In that case, a tough one it shall be..."""
,Whoa.
," I'd hoped that Genji-san would give me a simple puzzle, but now he's saying it'll be tough. Scary."
, But I'll beat both of them. I can't let myself get scared.
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Then let us start with mine. I am a doctor, so how about an ambulance puzzle?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The ??? is a number? But emergency is a word. You can't add a number to a word, right?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That part sounds like some kind of word game. After all, 'kyu-kyu-' means emergency, and 'kyu-' means nine. If you write two nines together, it looks like 99, doesn't it?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""So, if you add something to 99, you get an ambulance?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Hmm. Why does some number added to 99 get you an ambulance? .........Ah, I've got it!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh, really?! Hey, what is it?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I'll give you a hint. You've got a big advantage here that most people around the world don't have. *giggle* Then again, even people from other countries could narrow it down to two answers with a little math."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? ......Nnnnn......I don't get it..."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Oh, are you having trouble? I thought it was an easy puzzle."""
,It's a bit annoying to hear that about a puzzle I don't get.
," Still, no matter how annoyed I get, I still don't have a clue what the answer is."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Aw, so close. I thought you'd made it pretty far too..."""
,"Apparently, Eva oba-san knows the answer. She looked disappointed that I hadn't figured it out too."
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""......Mumumumu...? Ah, yes, I have it! If you subtract two from an ambulance, then add on 60, you can even learn the weather."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Well done, Kinzo-san. It seems I must hand this medal over to you."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahahahahahaha. Sorry, Ange. This medal's all mine."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......F, fine, see if I care."""
,The gold medal passed from Nanjo to Kinzo.
, That medal was supposed to be mine...... It's no use regretting it now.
, If you subtract two from and add 60 to an ambulance...? How would that tell you the weather...??
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Hmm, what was the number for the weather forecasting service, I wonder?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........???"""
,"Yeah, I don't have a clue. I'll just have to pick myself up and have a go at Genji's puzzle."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""20! Emergency sounds like 99, and if you add 20 to that, you get 119. That's the emergency number for ambulances!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""And if you subtract 20 from 130, you get 110. That's the emergency number for calling the police."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Splendid! That is correct. I knew you were a quick thinker, Ange-san."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oooooooh, well done, Angeeeeeeee! What a wise granddaughter I have!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Congratulations. This medal belongs to you."" ""But...what was that about the difference between the two being half an emergency?"" ""Heheh, yeah, we didn't really need that part. If you use that hint, you could make a pretty good guess at the answer even if you forgot what the emergency numbers were."" ""Huh??"""
,"At any rate, the gold medal glittering in Nanjo's hand is now mine."
," Okay, now I'll defeat Genji too and get another one."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Yes, that's the spirit. Let's solve more and more!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Your turn, Genji-san."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""My friend here doesn't speak much, but his knowledge is quite extensive. Even I cannot wait to see what sort of puzzle he whips up."""
Ronoue Genji,"""Now then, Ange-sama. Prepare yourself. The puzzle starts now."""
,......I've never heard anyone say 'prepare yourself' like that when giving a quiz.
, I started to get so tense that my stomach began to hurt...
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It'll be okay. Hang in there!"""
,"Eva oba-san gripped my hand firmly, and my stomachache got a little better."
Ronoue Genji,"""......Ange-sama, have you learned division?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Y, yeah. I learned it in cram school."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Incredible, a six-year-old who knows division?"""
Ronoue Genji,"""Then there should be no problems. Here it comes."""
,"This is bad... I did learn division, but I'm not very good at it......"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Half of its remaining length burns away each hour, right...? After the first hour, it's burned down by half of 5 centimeters. During the next hour, it burns down half of that remaining length. And during the third hour, it burns down half of that remaining length......"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I can't really do it without a calculator. Do you know the answer, Eva oba-san?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ah, ......I've got it. *giggle*, this is a pretty mean puzzle."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Why is it mean?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This has nothing to do with division. Read through the puzzle again carefully."""
,"......Umm, ......what was it, again......?"
Ronoue Genji,"""My sincere apologies, but that is incorrect."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh?! Why?! I know I did the math right...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You see, ...there's no need for math in this puzzle. Yep, he tricked us good this time..."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahhahahahahahaha. Too bad, Ange. Did you get it, Nanjo?"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Yes, of course. Division is unnecessary. This was an easy puzzle, one that even Ange-san could have solved."""
,"Not only Eva oba-san, but everyone else said that math wasn't needed."
, And I worked so hard on that division......
Ronoue Genji,"""That is all for my puzzle. I believe several others are waiting for you to challenge them, Ange-sama. Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Good luck, Ange-san. I am rooting for you."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. This is no time to get down! Now's our chance to turn things around."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah! I'll try even harder and get lots of medals!"""
,We dashed away.
, There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles. I have tons of chances to get medals.
," Okay, who should I challenge next...?!"
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......After one hour, the 5 centimeters becomes 2.5 centimeters, ...and in the next hour, that becomes 1.25 centimeters, ...and in the next hour, that becomes 0.625 centimeters......"""
Ronoue Genji,"""............"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ange-chan. You don't need to use math. Make sure you remember the problem clearly... How long...is the candle when it burns out...?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Ah! That was a close one...! The candle goes out when it's 1 centimeter long, so the rest doesn't matter!"""
,"The flame on this candle dies when the candle is 1 centimeter in length. In other words, it can never get shorter than 1 centimeter."
," So the right answer is the fifth choice, ""About 10mm""...!"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right...!"""
Ronoue Genji,"""You are correct."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oooh, splendidly done, Ange! How clever of you, not to be misled!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I didn't even need division. I almost got tricked...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You were pretty mean there, Genji-san. You even asked her if she could do division. That was a trap, right?"""
Ronoue Genji,"""Correct. My humble apologies."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Hahhahahahaha. After all, Genji-san is the sort who can trick you without changing his expression in the slightest."""
Ronoue Genji,"""Congratulations, Ange-sama. This medal is proof that you have correctly solved my puzzle."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thanks! Eheheh, I got another medal, Eva oba-san...!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Heheh, nice going!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I'll get lots more. I'll get a ton, and then Grandfather will give me a great prize!"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Yes. Give it all you've got, my granddaughter...!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Good luck, Ange-san. I am rooting for you."""
Ronoue Genji,"""There must be others waiting for you. Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Okay! Thank you. I'll try even harder now...!"""
,We dashed away.
, There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles. I have tons of chances to get medals.
," Okay, who should I challenge next...?! "
,"After Ange and Eva left, ......Battler, who had been watching their progress, came over."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""How is Ange doing?"""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Oh, Battler. I am not certain, but she does seem to be enjoying herself."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I heard your puzzle, Genji-san. Even I was almost taken in back there."""
Ronoue Genji,"""You honor me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Still, it's not quite what I'd have expected. Who'd have thought that you'd give a trick question like that? I figured you'd make a straightforward, simple puzzle."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Hahahahahahaha. You might expect such a thing from him, silent as he is, ......but he is much more of a schemer than he appears."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Very true. If you play a chess match against him, you'll see that right away."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""He even fools me, from time to time. He'll trick me right to my face, with that stern, serious expression of his. He has always been like that. And yet, despite the numerous occasions on which he has fooled me in the past, I keep on getting tricked. Wahhahhahahahahahaha."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Come to think of it, ......what sort of relationship do you and Genji-san have?"""
,"For just an instant, Kinzo glanced at Genji's face."
," Apparently, he didn't plan on touching on this subject if Genji had any objections."
," However, Genji spoke as though the matter was no longer a secret."
Ronoue Genji,"""......I knew the Master once...in Taiwan."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""Wahaha, 'knew me', he says...! We were partners in crime, you might say! The two of us were both prodigal sons of rich families. A pair of ruffians who caused their parents nothing but trouble."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Genji-san, a prodigal son...? That's a surprise...... So, Genji-san also moved to Taiwan, where he met Grandfather?"""
Ronoue Genji,""".........No. I am a native of Taiwan."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Genji-san was born in Taiwan. ......Well, since Taiwan was under Japanese rule before the war, he is still Japanese, of course."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,"""He was a man who hated losing. When we first met, we fought all the time. Once we hit it off, we became the best of friends."""
Ronoue Genji,"""......There was a lot of disorder and conflict after the war. The Master is the one who saved me during that chaotic period. ......If I spent the rest of my life trying to repay that debt, it would not be enough to pay it back in full."""
Ushiromiya Kinzo,""".........Don't say that, my friend. ......If only I had been a little more persuasive, I might have saved your family as well... I was too cowardly to save anyone but you..."""
,"I don't know much about the details of Taiwan's history, but apparently, there was still a lot of chaos there even after the war ended and Japan pulled out."
," Kinzo, predicting this chaos before it happened, worked out a way for Genji and his family to escape."
," However, Genji's family possessed great wealth in Taiwan. They were unable to abandon it, and they decided to remain there."
, This wealth had been built up thanks to their close relationship with the Japanese-run government of Taiwan.
, The new regime after the war wasn't likely to welcome them with open arms.
, Much mayhem and confusion followed. And Genji was the only one who escaped harm.
,"......I don't know what happened to make this man, who Kinzo has called a troublesome prodigal son, change so drastically to become the person he is today."
," It was a story of friendship between the two of them, ......and there could be hardly any point in an unrelated person sifting through history books to interpret it however they pleased."
," They had been good friends since long ago, and they owed each other their lives. Though the troubled times had tossed them about, their friendship held firm for decades..."
," Genji's role was now that of the butler, ......but when they are alone in the study, they sometimes share a drink and reminisce about the days of their youth."
,......And they're still that way today.
," Leaving Kinzo and Genji to reminisce, Battler walked off on his own."
," It would be rude to ask for any more detail, and he didn't need to know."
," Kinzo and Genji had been friends since long, long ago. That was something he already knew."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""What do you think? Do you want to challenge Natsuhi oba-san and Krauss oji-san next?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah. Let's beat them!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hahahaha. Very well, we'll play along."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""The two of us have prepared some formidable puzzles for you."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Should I go first? Or you?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I will start."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Very well."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Listen closely to what I'm about to say. White black white black white ???? black white black white black white."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? White black white black......huh??"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I'll say it once more. White black white black white ???? black white black white black white. ......What does the '????' stand for?"""
,This is......a really hard one.
, White black white black white ? black white black white black white.
," It looks like the white and black are alternating, but the '????' is between a white and a black."
, Is it......gray?? Is it that easy...?
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Th, ...this is a surprisingly hard one, coming from you, Natsuhi nee-san......"""
,"Eva oba-san was groaning. Apparently, this one's really hard."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I, is it really so hard...?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......There's a chance that some people won't understand, if they haven't had the right experiences."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Eva-san aside, I think Ange-chan would have seen it a lot at school and kindergarten......"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wh, what the heck? I don't have a clue!!"""
,Is it a problem that I could get easier than Eva oba-san......?
,......It's hard.
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The hint for this one is probably what Natsuhi nee-san said, about something you might see in a school or kindergarten. ......Do you know what it is, Ange-chan?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No, I'm stuck."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""See, even Ange-chan says she's stuck! Give her at least a little hint."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""I, I see. Then, a hint...... They may be different colors, but you get a beautiful sound no matter which you push."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""A beautiful sound......? Are these black and white things something that make sounds?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Black and white things that make a sound when you push them......?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........I don't get it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I give up too. ......It seems even you know some pretty hard puzzles, Natsuhi nee-san."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hahahaha. It's the sort of puzzle that brings out one's upbringing. Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wh, what did you saaaaaaay...?!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Natsuhi oba-san. Could you tell me the answer?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""The answer is...a keyboard."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""A keyboard? Like on a piano?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That's right. The blacks and whites are the pattern of colors on a keyboard. In which case, you must already know the right answer."""
,"Natsuhi oba-san smiled at me, but I don't really remember what a keyboard looks like."
,"......Nnn, too bad."
, I'd better have a go at Krauss oji-san's puzzle and redeem myself.
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ready? It's Nii-san's turn now. We'll solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That black and white thing......it's a keyboard! Like a piano!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Ah, ......is that it?! It's a keyboard?!"""
,"Something that can be found in kindergartens and schools, which is covered with a line of white and black things."
, It's an instrument. Like a keyboard on a piano or a melodica.
Ushiromiya Eva,"""The first two black keys are between 'do', 're', and 'mi'. The set of three black keys are between 'fa', 'so', 'la', and 'ti'......"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It started 'white black white black white ? black', so......the three white ones are 'do', 're', and 'mi'......"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""There is no black key between 'mi' and 'fa'. So, 'fa' comes right after 'mi'!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""And since the question mark comes after 'mi', the right answer is 'fa'. ......In other words-"""
,"""""The right answer is white!"""""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Correct. I thought it might have been a bit too hard, but you did well."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Splendidly done, you two. Go ahead, Natsuhi."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Congratulations, Ange-chan. Here's my medal for you."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Alright! Eva oba-san, I got another one!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Things are moving along nicely. Next up is Nii-san's puzzle. Let's solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""How interesting. Looks like it's time you were taught a lesson."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Stop it, Eva oba-san! Don't provoke him! You'll make the puzzle harder!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Heheheheheheh. If there's anyone you have to blame, it's Eva! Now take this brain-twister! Here's a puzzle about the tenants of a skyscraper I've invested in."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I don't know anything about this skyscraper, so there's no way I could know......"""
,"I know what's in floors five and above, so the answer must be somewhere between floor one and floor four. There's no doubt about that."
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Heheheheh. Do you give up?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I, I won't give up, kiii!! So, you're saying that Murakoshi Publishing Co., Ltd. is on this floor X?!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Not floor X. The _th floor."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's the same either way, isn't it...?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Ah. ............"""
,"Eva oba-san suddenly stumbled on something. Then, she started counting on her fingers, starting from the first floor......"
Ushiromiya Eva,"""I've got it, Ange-chan...! Try saying them aloud, starting from the first floor...! There's only one that fits!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? Wh, what do you mean......?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I don't get it."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's 'the _th floor', not 'floor X'. That's the trick."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""That's right. Though, in a way, the answer is right there in the question."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What do you mean...?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""For example, let's take floor 7. You'd call that 'the seventh floor', right? But you wouldn't call floor 3 'the threeth floor', would you?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Precisely. From floor 1 to floor 4, there's only one floor that ends in 'th'."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""A, ......ah........."""
,"By this point, even I had figured out the answer."
, If only I'd paid a bit more attention to the way Krauss oji-san said the question......
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hahahahahahaha. Too bad. Looks like I'll be keeping this medal."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The 4th floor!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Mu..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Well done, you got it...! From floor one to floor four, there's only one floor that ends in 'th'...the 4th floor."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah! The 4th floor fits, but the other ones are the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""N, ......nicely done... And even I didn't figure it out until I had the answer given to me......"""
,"Apparently, Krauss oji-san once had this puzzle shown to him, and he wasn't able to answer it right."
, He looked a bit downcast to see a kid like me solve it.
,"......For some reason, he looked even more mortified to see that Eva had solved it. How strange."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Come on, now. Let's see that medal."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""This medal is a mark of Ange-chan's intelligence. I mustn't let you have it, Eva."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Heh, sore loser...!"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Thank you, Krauss oji-san. Am I incredible?!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Very much so. You're a more flexible thinker than your uncle. I am proud to have you as a niece."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""That's all for our puzzles."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I do hope you enjoyed them."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""I did! Thank you, Natsuhi oba-san and Krauss oji-san!"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""I hope you can enjoy all the tricky questions, without worrying about your medal count too much."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""We all hope that this becomes a wonderful night, just for you."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""We really are enjoying ourselves."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Yeah! We're having a lot of fun!"""
,Krauss and Natsuhi smiled at them as they dashed away.
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh, it's you, Natsuhi. How did your puzzles go?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""We did the best we could, ......but I'm not sure how much they enjoyed them."""
,"On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medals they had gathered so far."
," Ange and Eva. ......Such an unexpected pairing, but they looked like they were having a great time."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......A future parent and child, unrelated by blood. Watching them like this, they look just like a normal parent and child."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Yes, they do. ......Bonds between people are nurtured by the heart. Ties of blood do not bond as strongly."""
,"After saying this, ......Natsuhi bit back her own words and stared at the floor."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What's wrong?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......I was just...surprised that I would dare to say such words..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................You don't need to worry about me."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Because I rejected you, ......you met a painful fate in so many worlds... ......All of that is my responsibility..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I understand how you felt. ......Unable to become pregnant, you were forced to feel shame for many years. In that situation, any woman would be shocked if they were handed a baby whose parentage they didn't even know, ...and then told to adopt them."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......That was no reason... for me to push you off a cliff..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""True. You will have to carry that cross for the rest of your life."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......Yes. I am prepared to do so..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""In that case, the suffering you must endure will come from the cross you bear. Not from me."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""You don't......despise me...?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Don't make that dejected face. ......No, perhaps it's the other way around. As long as you continue making that dejected face, I will feel no desire to punish you. As long as you continue to carry that cross, I will feel no desire to hate you."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Do you mean......that you don't hate me......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""To tell the truth, I did hate you. I hated your guts. I hated you so much, I wanted to hang up a pillow with your picture on it and use it as a punching bag!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""But, as I watched you, that feeling faded away. ......You regretted and lamented. And I'm sure you'll never forget that feeling for as long as you live."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""How could I forget......? ......After all, I'm a murderer......"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Your cross is a heavy one, doubtless. I can feel compassion for you now. I'm serious. After all, Kinzo was the one at fault, right?"
{f:5:Beatrice}," It's his fault for having an illegitimate child in the first place! And the way he forced that child on you was even worse! He should at least have been able to avoid hurting you by saying 'please take care of this poor child', instead of 'you can't give birth, so adopt this kid'. Men! That Kinzo...!"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""............"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I no longer hate you. Does the cross you bear not feel any lighter for that?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""It doesn't. ......I still don't know how I can make up for what I did to you."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Then let's do it this way. Hold out your arms."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""H, ......huh? L, ...like this...?"""
,"As Natsuhi spread her arms uncertainly, Beato leapt forward and hugged her tight."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......U, umm, ......th, this is a little..."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I'll never say this again, so let me say it once. ......After all, I never had a chance to meet my mother."""
,"Still hugging Natsuhi, Beato spoke in a whisper. She spoke those words that she would certainly never say again..."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Thank you for worrying so much for my sake. ......But I really don't hate you anymore. Please, believe that, .........Mother."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......B, ......Beatrice........."""
