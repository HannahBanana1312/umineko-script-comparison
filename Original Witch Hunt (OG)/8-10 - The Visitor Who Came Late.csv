Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Somebodyyyyyyyyy!! Is anyone there?! Onii-chaaaaaaaan!! Waaaaaahh!!"""
,"Ange flew out of the guesthouse, sobbing."
, Is there anyone still alive on this island? 
,"When she checked the cousins' room earlier, it had been completely empty."
," However, she remembered that she hadn't seen Battler, George, or Maria's bodies."
, What she didn't know was whether this meant they were safe...or whether she was about to be reunited with them as corpses.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Where are they?! Wheeeeeeeeere?!! Answer meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"""
,She dashed around through the rain.
, Where was she going? Nowhere in particular.
," The lost little sister dashed around in circles, searching for her brother."
, Drenched with rain and all alone......
,".........Eventually, I thought I heard my brother's voice from beyond a bush."
," No, it wasn't just his voice. I heard George onii-chan's and Maria onee-chan's voices too."
," I called out at the top of my lungs, but they didn't answer."
, But it's okay now. They're right there. Just on the other side of the fence.
, I could even faintly see them through the fence.
," When I ran around the fence, I found myself standing in front of a shed or something."
, It must be a shed to store tools for the rose garden.
, The three of them were standing in front of the shed.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Onii-chan...!!"""
,"I cried out, but my voice didn't reach them. Even though I yelled so loudly? "
,Something felt very wrong about all this.
,"......When people hear a voice, even when they pretend not to have heard it, their bodies tend to show some sign that they've noticed."
," However, there was no trace of that in the three of them."
," Even though I was screaming so loud, ......it truly wasn't reaching their ears."
," The instant I understood that, ......my dash towards them slowed and came to a halt."
," Though we appeared to be in the same world, ......we were actually in different worlds entirely."
, It was like a TV. Or was it more like ghosts...? 
,"I could see them clearly, ......but as far as they were concerned, I didn't exist."
,"......After all, look."
," Even if I stand right in front of them, ......their eyes can't see me."
," If I try and touch them, will I really be able to?......What if my hand just went right through..."
," I was so scared at the thought......that I could do nothing but stand there in shock, even though I was so close to them..."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Dammit...!! I don't have a clue anymore...! Someone must have snuck in from outside the island after all!! And that person massacred the Ushiromiya family!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......No matter how much we lock ourselves in, someone always gets killed. ......Uu-! It's the work of a witch after all!"""
Ushiromiya George,"""Everyone, calm down...! Let's calm down and think. ......No one exists on this island except those with a direct relation to the Ushiromiya family."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That doesn't make sense...! After all, we've just seen several murders that'd be impossible for any one of us!"""
Ushiromiya George,"""......Well, that's true...... But is it really? Maybe we've just missed something."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Missed something?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""For example...... .........That's right, maybe someone was playing dead! Since we're the only ones on this island, the culprit must be one of us. That would mean that someone we thought was dead was actually faking...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""But Aniki, that's impossible! Every one of the corpses was checked by someone! There's no way any of them were faking!"""
Ushiromiya George,"""I don't want to think about it, ...but what if those corpse inspections......were also faked?"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......Uu-...?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""Let's put it this way. There were multiple culprits from the start. Then, one plays dead, and the other lies and confirms that the first culprit died. Then, the culprit who played dead keeps on committing crimes, creating the illusion that some stranger has snuck onto the island...!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Do you......still suspect someone in the Ushiromiya family of being the culprit?!"""
Ushiromiya George,"""......Doctor Nanjo was killed. Since he was killed, it's probably safe to say that he isn't a culprit. And, we can consider the examinations performed by a doctor like him to be the most reliable."""
,"If so, then we can probably assume that the people whose death Nanjo checked were almost certainly dead."
, Who did Nanjo check? 
,Genji's corpse. Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses. Shannon's corpse. Gohda and Kumasawa's corpses.
Ushiromiya George,"""Think back to the beginning and the bodies in the dining hall. Of those six victims, Doctor Nanjo only inspected Genji-san."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......But didn't the rest of us check the others?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""Yes, but Doctor Nanjo didn't actually inspect them himself."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What are you talking about?! How the hell could our parents have survived after being killed like that?!"
Ushiromiya Battler," Anyway, what do you think you're saying, George-aniki?! Wouldn't that mean one of our parents is the culprit?! That's insane!!"
Ushiromiya Battler," They were killed right at the beginning, and so many of them...! How can you go calling our parents culprits on top of that?! I won't let anyone, not even you, suspect and slander our parents after they've been killed like that...!!"""
Ushiromiya George,""".........S, ......sorry......"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""......I know my Mama was really dead. So, does that mean George onii-chan's parents or Battler's parents were the culprits?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""Let's stop with that, Maria-chan...... I must have lost it a bit back there..."""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""George onii-chan wouldn't kill Shannon."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""That's enough...! None of us would kill our family, right?!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""So, I don't think George onii-chan would lie and say his parents were dead, not if they were really alive. ......There's no way George onii-chan would help out in a crime if Shannon was going to be killed."""
,"Calmly, ......as though answering a quiz or a riddle, Maria spoke to George."
," Then, with a blank look on her face, she turned to Battler and spoke."
Ushiromiya Maria,""".........Battler, you saw your Dad's and Mom's corpses, right?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, I saw them!! We all saw them right?! Those pitiful, blood-stained......!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""I think you're lying."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Huh?! Where the hell did that come from?!!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Because that way, it all makes sense. ......Back in the dining hall, Battler's parents weren't dead. One of them killed Natsuhi oba-san and Krauss oji-san, locked the door from the inside, and waited in that room. ......The other one took over the murders after that."
Ushiromiya Maria," ......To break open the closed room of the guesthouse, they needed to have an accomplice inside. That was Battler. ......That explains everything."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""E, enooooooooooooough!!!"""
Ushiromiya George,"""S, stop it, Battler-kun...! You too, Maria-chan...!"""
Ushiromiya Maria,"""Finally, all the pieces fit together in the Wolves and Sheep puzzle in my head. ......The culprits are Battler's family. Uu-. ......Am I right?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Wh, what are you talking abooooooooout?!!!"""
,"{a:c: ""Correct.""}"
,"The voice came from behind Ange. She spun around, surprised."
,"......There, covered in blood, ......yet wearing cheery expressions, ...were Rudolf and Kyrie."
Ushiromiya George,"""Rudolf oji-san, Kyrie oba-san, ......I, I'm so glad you're sa-"""
,"After saying that much, George realized what the words meant, and his face twisted into an expression of shock and horror."
," Maria wasn't surprised. However, she showed no joy at having her answer proved correct."
, And Battler...
,......Ange...saw it.
, That terrible expression...one that she would never forget as long as she lived.
, It was...a demon's smile.
," A hideous demon that she'd never be able to look at again twisted its face in a foul grin, and the truly horrible thing was..."
, That she saw it......on her brother's face......
, Rudolf and Kyrie lifted up the guns they had been holding behind them.
," The barrels were pointed at the foreheads of George, who was staggering backwards, and Maria, who was grinning as though she didn't care what happened."
, There was a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder. Nothing more could be heard.
," Then, as George and Maria were snapped around by that roar, ......the strings holding them were snipped."
, The two dolls fell into puddles with a splash...and stopped moving......
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......D, ......Dad......Mom......"""
,All of this occurred right before Ange's eyes...
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Heh...hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Eheheheheheh, hahahahahahahahahaha!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ihihihihihihihahahahahahahahahaha!!"""
,"Ange, who stood stunned beside them, wasn't visible to their eyes."
," They guffawed, overcome with laughter. Then, right in front of Ange, they started joking and complimenting each other on their kills so far."
," The three hideous faces......the faces of her family......made Ange want to cry and vomit at the same time, and she felt as though she would suffocate."
," Ange dashed away, covering her mouth."
, She wanted to escape the disgusting laughter coming from her beloved family as soon as possible.
," Then, she slipped and fell face-down in a puddle of mud."
, Ange didn't try to get up.
," In fact, she instead chose to cover her ears to block out the disgusting laughter that she could still hear."
," As she did, ......from the shadows of the fences and bushes in this inky-black rose garden......several dark things slipped into sight."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............?!?!"""
,Ange looked around herself in surprise......to see that eerie black shapes had appeared from all over the garden...and were slowly surrounding her.
, It was......a crowd of people with goat heads.
, Their outfits were all different.
," Some wore suits, while others were dressed casually. However, all of them were covered with darkness, and all of them had goat heads."
," Ange, bewildered, accidentally let her hands fall from her ears."
," By now, she couldn't hear that disgusting laughter."
," However, in their place, ......she could hear the words spoken by the goats."
,『.........Kyrie and Rudolf are...the culprits.』
,『Battler is the culprit......Battler is the culprit......』
,『......Battler culprit theory. Battler's family culprit theory......』
,"As the goats continued to mumble in eerie voices, ......they surrounded Ange and began to draw nearer."
," They all pressed around her, each of them speaking of Ange's family as the culprits......"
,".........At first, everyone had joined in on the Eva culprit theory."
," The sole survivor from Rokkenjima had gotten almost all of the wealth to herself, so the theory was only natural."
, Why was Ushiromiya Eva the only one who escaped to Kuwadorian? And why did she refuse so stubbornly to talk about what happened that day? 
,It was decided that the Eva culprit theory explained all of this.
," However, when Eva died of illness, and people learned that all the vast wealth she had created by unscrupulous means would go to Ange, public opinion...or rather, the Forgers...created a new culprit theory and spread it around."
, This was......the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory'.
," If it was normal for everyone to come to the family conferences, why was Ange the only one who didn't come this time? "
,Did Rudolf's family have some reason for not bringing the young Ange with them? 
,"They did take Battler, but he wasn't Kyrie's son."
," Then, when it was revealed in some magazines that Kyrie's family had close ties to a massive gangster organization, all eyes suddenly gathered on Kyrie herself."
," Then, the truth was also laid bare about how Rudolf had made a killing out of fraudulent business practices, and almost immediately, the couple became thought of as the most suspicious people on the island."
," Hideyoshi and Eva's company might have been rough, but at least it had operated within the law."
," However, the more Rudolf's company was investigated, the more dirt was dug up."
," Furthermore, trouble surrounding some party tickets from the time Rudolf and Kyrie were students was also testified to, and it was clear that they were far more suspicious than Eva's family."
," And so, in a flash, ......the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory' expelled the other conspiracy theories, including the Eva culprit theory, and reigned as the greatest of them all."
,......It wasn't really because it was more plausible than the Eva culprit theory.
, They had just gotten bored of the old theory and wanted a new sensation......
, The goats seemed to bend and undulate.
," The sky rapidly turned white, ......becoming a ceiling lit by fluorescent lamps."
," The goats had changed completely, ......becoming the shapes of girls......wearing goat masks."
, All of the girls were wearing the same clothes.
, It was a uniform. ......The uniform of Saint Lucia Academy.
,『......Did you hear the real culprits were Rudolf and Kyrie?』
,"『Oh, I heard that! Yeah, I knew there was something suspicious about them leaving their kid behind!』"
,『Didn't Ushiromiya Eva say herself that she was poisoned to death?! Isn't it obvious who was behind that?!』
,"『Must be nice for her. She gets her whole family's riches all to herself, right?』"
,『I always knew the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory' was right!』
,"『Hey, don't you think there's something strange about Ushiromiya-san?』"
,『*whisper*whisper*whisper*.』
,『*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.』
,『Rudolf and Kyrie are culprits.』
,『Isn't Battler a culprit too?』
,『Rudolf's family culprit theory!』
,『Rudolf and Kyrie are culprits!』
,"『They tried to get the family wealth all to themselves, but Eva killed them back and they failed-』"
,"『But in the end, Ushiromiya Ange gets everything anyway, doesn't she?』"
,"『Rudolf and Kyrie are the culprits, of course!』"
,『Rudolf's family culprit theory!』
,『Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler are the culprits!』
,『Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler are the culprits!!』
,"『They're saying your family were the culprits, Ushiromiya-san!』"
,"『What do you think of that? Hey, what do you think?!』"
,"『But in the end, you get all the family wealth to yourself, don't you?!』"
,"『Even at the end, Ushiromiya Eva never told you anything, right?!』"
,『I always knew there was something wrong with that girl!』
,『This also explains why Eva hated you so much!』
,"『Hey, hey, say something, tell us what you think!』"
,"『She really is a creepy kid, isn't she?』"
,"『At least say something about what you think of this theory, creep!!』"
,"A blade of air swept over me as I crouched down, holding my head."
," In a flash, the illusion of girl students with goat heads that surrounded me shattered."
,"......I was curled up in a puddle in the rainy rose garden, surrounded by goats."
," But then, those goats were also sliced in half, and the upper halves slid to the side."
, It was like seeing a master swordsman slicing through a stick of bamboo.
,"{a:c: ""This way......!""}"
,The voice came from......that black cat. The black cat with the bell that had guided me here.
, Incredible that it can talk...... But that doesn't matter now. I dashed after it.
, The goats shrank back.
, A hole opened up in the encirclement. The black cat dashed through it.
," As I hurried through it, the goats began to chase after me."
, Countless heavy footsteps thundered behind us.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Wh, ......where are we running to, Mr. Cat...?!"""
,The cat ignored my stupid question.
, Where are we running to? It's obvious. As far away as we can make it.
," However, there was an unbelievable number of goats."
," It wasn't just the group chasing us. There were probably goats hiding throughout the rose garden, and everywhere we went, a group of them would appear and block our path."
," Each time we bumped into them, we ran down a different path in this maze of a rose garden."
," So, I didn't even know which direction we were running in anymore."
," It couldn't be... We aren't running around in circles inside a massive crowd of goats, are we...? "
,"When we ran into the arbor once more, I learned that my fears were justified."
," The four paths that led from the arbor were all blocked by a crowd of goats. Of course, the path we had come down was also blocked by our pursuers."
," There was nowhere to go to, nowhere to return to. ......We were finally...trapped......"
Ushiromiya Ange,"""M, Mr. Cat, ......what should we do? W, we're surrounded......!!"""
,"""............"""
,"The black cat glared at the goats that surrounded us, standing on guard."
, It's...all over for us......
," At that moment, I found myself floating in the air."
," A massive arm, large enough to crush my entire head, had grabbed my collar from behind."
," Before I could even think to cry out, ......I saw, right in front of my face, a pair of strangely glowing red eyes, and a massive mouth with jagged teeth and a foul breath."
," The mouth...opened wide... and, as though it was a separate creature, ......a bizarre tongue stuck itself out."
," Then, ......it spat words at me."
,"『.........Rudolf, Kyrie, and Battler are the culprits...... ......Rudolf and Kyrie played dead, and Battler lied when he inspected them...... Then, one of the parents carried out the murders until the second twilight and hid under the bed in Natsuhi's room. ......Battler killed Shannon, and then assisted in the murders in the guesthouse. ......The other parent carried out the guesthouse murders...... This is......the truth.........』"
,"Then, ......that gaping, smelly mouth......slowly began to close over Ange's head......"
,"""Counter. ......{p:2:It's possible to form a logical theory other than the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory'.}"""
,"A blue flash......sliced off the top of the mouth that was trying to eat Ange's head, sending it flying."
," I fell into a puddle, along with the goat that was still grasping my collar, though there was nothing left of it above its chin."
," Without any hesitation, ......the goats stretched out their thick arms, as though this was their chance to snatch this prey for themselves...and they rushed towards me. All of them spoke in unison."
,『{p:2:Everything except the Rudolf's family culprit theory is impossibllle.........Absolutely impossibllle...!!}』
,"""{p:1:It's possible to form a logical theory other than the Rudolf's family culprit theory. {p:2:For example, a theory with George's family as the culprits is possible.}"""
,"A red flash and a blue line became blades of wind that passed over my head, doubly slicing the arms of a goat that tried to pick me up."
," I think the next goats dashed, not towards me, ......but towards the black cat that was protecting me from behind."
," As I sat on my butt, staring up at the rainy night's sky, the massive goats were in the air right above me, fighting the black cat...or someone."
,"『{p:2:George's family culprit theory is impossiiible! George can't kill Shannnnnnon!! So he can't be a culprit, and he can't faaaake when checking corpses!!!}』"
,"""{p:1:No, it is possible. A 'culprit' is defined as 'one who murders'. It never says that they have to murder someone who appears in the story. ......In other words. If George committed murder outside the island, sometime before this crime, he could be a 'culprit' without killing anyone on the island, and it would be possible for him to lie.}"""
,The deep-red curves cut by the swings bit into the goat.
," Its massive body was knocked into the air......became a bunch of about seven logs of flesh, and was thrown into the rose bushes."
," This time, the terrible force of the attack shocked the goats. They faltered, shook, stepped back."
,"......Finally, I understood."
," That red slice. ......It had come from a weapon that could draw red slashes...no, it also drew blue slashes just a second ago. A massive scythe that could speak both types of truth, red and blue, at will."
," I looked up at the sky, ......then let my head hang down backwards."
, There was no black cat there.
, It was a girl......holding a large scythe......
Furudo Erika,"""How's that? This level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika."""
,"When the crowd of goats recognized the girl who called herself Erika, ......a stir passed through it."
, It was clear that this person had enough of a reputation to make them tremble.
," Erika lifted me up, flew into the air, and landed on top of the arbor."
," Then, she let go of me and, still wielding her scythe, made an elegant curtsy to the crowd of goats surrounding us."
Furudo Erika,"""This is probably the first time most of you have met me. Allow me to introduce myself! Pleased to meet you, everyone! I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!"
Furudo Erika," ......Let's have the blockheads who can only think of the Rudolf's family culprit theory step down! If anyone thinks they can counter my argument, please feel free! Of course, I won't be holding back either!!"""
,"The goats all howled at once. It seemed to be a cry of shock, of fear, or possibly of wonder."
," The goats surrounded the arbor...chattering, but not moving any closer."
," None of them had the courage to stand against this detective, this Witch of Truth called Furudo Erika..."
Furudo Erika,"""......Good grief. All those thousands, and this is the best you can do? None of you has the courage to fight Furudo Erika in a battle of words?"
Furudo Erika," ......Too bad. Let's put an end to this. Then again, I, Furudo Erika, ......don't have enough spare time to counter all you blockheads one by one. I'll let her clean up the rest. ......You're up!!"""
,"When Erika cried out, red cracks opened in the dark night's sky."
," It looked like the spiderweb-shaped fissures that appear when a glass window has been struck hard. ......No, it actually was a spiderweb, colored blood-red."
,"""......*giggle*giggle*, ......kyahahahahahahaha......!"""
,A laugh rang out through the spiderweb-covered world.
, ......A witch's laugh.
," It sounded somehow familiar to Ange... And there, ......standing on the spiderweb and gazing down on the goats who must have looked like bugs caught in, was the witch."
{f:5:Eva Beatrice},"""You forget me, ......and you call HIM the ruler of Rokkenjima......? You forget me, and you think Rudolf is the culpriiiit...? Kyahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"""
,"It was the witch who had hidden inside of Eva. The witch of the future, who would one day call herself the Endless Witch after the cat box closed over this world."
{f:5:Eva Beatrice},"""Who forgets EVA Beatrice and calls themselves the murderer of Rokkenjima?! How impertinent! On this island, who lives and who dies is totally up to me!! All the wealth and gold is mine!! Everything about October 4th and 5th in 1986 is mine to do with as I please! It all belongs to me, EVA Beatrice!!"""
,"EVA swung her One-winged staff at the crowd of foolish goats beneath her, proclaiming their deaths."
, The spiderwebs which formed a ceiling that covered the heavens plummeted...and more spiderwebs seeped out of the ground at the goats' feet.
," Then, the webs from above and below met, and thousands upon thousands of goats were caught in their grasp."
," Then, as EVA swung her staff, it swirled. Around and around, like egg yolk being mixed in a bowl."
," Eventually, it was all packed to a massive, blood-red goo."
, The moans of goats drifted out from inside.
, That entire crowd had been compressed into a meatball a few meters across.
{f:5:Eva Beatrice},"""So, you morons doubt that I'm the culprit?!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Reaching the Eva culprit theory and giving up there is good enough for the likes of you."""
{f:5:Eva Beatrice},"""Why don't you just get crushed and disappeeeeeear?!?!"""
,*squelch*.
, No other word could do that sound justice.
," After sucking in all of those goats, the spider web ball vanished into thin air with a squelch."
," After that, there wasn't even a trace left. The dark rose garden lay there without any sound but that of the falling rain......"
, EVA drifted down from the sky.
{f:5:Eva Beatrice},"""Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange-chan. ......I'll never let anyone insult your family."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""E, ......Eva oba-san......"""
,I knew I should be grateful.
," And yet, ......it really wasn't easy for me to believe that Eva oba-san was my ally."
, EVA realized that too.
{f:5:Eva Beatrice},"""Don't worry. I'm not doing this because I want to be thanked. But I'll always be on your side. ......See you later."""
,"She giggled, spun around, and vanished..."
," Now that she had already left, I started to regret not saying even a thank you..."
," So, ......I figured I should at least thank the other person who had saved me."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Thanks......for saving me... Who......are you...?"""
,I already knew her name.
, What I was really asking......was why she had saved me.
Furudo Erika,"""I'm Furudo Erika, the detective. ......And I'm also a witch."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......A witch...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""The Witch of Truth. ......The one who searches for the Single Truth. And......you're the same, aren't you?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".................."""
,"Those two days... October 4th and 5th, 1986."
," I've been so desperate to know what happened...that I took a step off the roof of that skyscraper, ......drifted through several witch games and Fragment worlds, and abandoned myself to this long journey with no rewards."
, All I want......is to know what happened that day.
, All I want......is the Single Truth of that day.
Furudo Erika,"""Looking for something like that is what makes someone a Witch of Truth. So, you're just the same as me. ......That's why I came to save you."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I...want to know. ......Just what happened on that day? No one will tell me! No one knows...! But I know something happened that day!"
Ushiromiya Ange," I'd give up anything to learn what that was...! That's the one thing I need to know no matter what, even if it kills me...! So tell me! You know, don't you?! You know what happened on this island, right?!"""
Furudo Erika,"""......Does a Witch of Truth expect to be given the truth? If I told you that so-and-so was the truth, would you really just accept whatever I said...?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No, ......I wouldn't........."""
Furudo Erika,"""What did Battler-san show you today?"""
,"......Today, ......Onii-chan showed me a bizarre Halloween party."
," It may have been heart-warming and a lot of fun, but......"
, It definitely......wasn't the truth.
Furudo Erika,"""Didn't Battler-san show you that and say it was the truth?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No way. ......That couldn't......be the truth!"""
Furudo Erika,"""Sometimes, other people will try to mislead us by claiming they know the truth. ......But a real Witch of Truth must continue to pursue the Single Truth without being led astray. That's why you can't accept the fake truth that Battler-san's trying to force on you. ......You care about finding the one real truth more than anything."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............Yeah..."""
,Onii-chan......is trying to confuse me.
, I've felt that this whole time.
," Even though he knows everything about what happened that day, ......he won't tell me anything at all."
," How is he any different from Eva oba-san, who mocked me and refused to tell me anything, even until the very moment of her death?"
,...Why won't Onii-chan tell me?............
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Why...?"""
Furudo Erika,"""............"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Why......won't he tell me?!"""
,The dam inside my heart burst.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Why won't Onii-chan...tell me what really happened?!! Why? Why...?!! I'm the only one who doesn't know!! No one's telling me the truth!! Tell me!! Tell me what happened that day, Onii-chan!! Onii-chaaaaaaaan!!!"""
,I cried out at the rainy night sky.
," Hot tears poured from my eyes, but they were covered by the cold rain that beat against me, so no one other than me would know that they were tears."
,......No one would know my pain and sadness.
, I'm......always the only one alone......all alone...
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Someone, tell me!!! Tell me what happened that day!!!"""
Furudo Erika,"""......No one can tell you. ......After all, you can only find the truth if you do it yourself."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Where is the truth?! How can I find it?! Everyone's hiding it! They won't tell me! I'll find it myself...! So please, just tell me where the truth is hidden...!"""
,"{a:c: ""......Very well. I can tell you.""}"
,"As that voice rang out, the world bent and swirled. After blinking several times, ......I realized that the world had become a sea of stars."
," No, that's not quite right. There are stars up there in the sky, but those lights below me aren't stars."
," They're lights from building windows, street lights, car lights."
,......I was floating in the dark sky......over a city lined with skyscrapers.
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I can't tell you what the truth is. ......However, if it's a question of how the truth can be reached, ......I can show you the way."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You............"""
,Various bad memories are jumping out at me from the back of my mind.
,......That's right. I was chained in place in that strange theater thing......and forced to watch a repulsive Fragment where Mom and Dad committed murder......
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I never said that what you saw was the truth."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""B, but you used the red to......"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You yelled out and interrupted, and stopped me from saying any more. ......This is all truth 'of a sort, but not necessarily true'. That's what I was about to say."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Just how far are you willing to go to mock me......?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I apologize. But I did want to test you."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Test me how?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""I wanted to see if you were ready to accept the truth, no matter what it may be."""

Ushiromiya Ange,"""........."""
,I have no comeback.
, Finding the truth is my goal. I just want to know what happened on that island on that day.
,......I don't think of myself as wanting to hear only the facts that are pleasing to me.
,"......Have I really been prepared to face the bloody, unbearable truth that's probably waiting there for me...?"
,"......If I find the truth, ......it'll mean having to look straight at my family's tragic final moments and accepting them as they are."
," And if I do accept that, ......it means abandoning my faint hope for that convenient miracle......the idea that one of them might have survived somehow......and might return even though 12 years have passed."
," Even though I know a miracle like that would be completely ridiculous, ......if I'm honest with myself, I have to admit that the faint hope it brought me has given me comfort these past 12 years."

Ushiromiya Ange,"""It won't."""
,"After hearing my immediate reply, Bernkastel stared at me."
, Are those expressionless eyes of hers......measuring my resolve? 
,Now that my brother is covering up the truth even after becoming Game Master... The only thing I can rely on in my search for the truth is the path that Bernkastel can show me...

,How long has it been since I last heard Bernkastel use that word?
,"......Yes. Not since that time at the very beginning, when I met her in this future world and became a witch, with her as my guardian."

{f:5:Beatrice},"""It was fun! I guarantee it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Same here. At first, I thought there was no way anyone could solve it, but the way you can use one confirmed purple statement after another to narrow down the suspects made for a nice puzzle."""

Furfur,"""Just what sort of game is Lady Bernkastel's mystery?!"""
,"""""That's for you to find out for yourselves!!"""""
,Objects resembling chessboards were set out on several tables.

{f:5:Virgilia},"""Quite an orthodox one, don't you think?"""
Ushiromiya George,"""So this is what a witch's game is like."""
Ushiromiya Jessica,"""Hmm. Looking at it like this, it's just a game. ......But for the pieces, it's a massive series of crimes."""

Dlanor,"""It would not do to waste such a rare gift from Lady BERNKASTEL. Let us take this opportunity to enjoy OURSELVES."""
Ushiromiya Lion,"""Still, this is a tough one...... It almost makes you wonder if it was even made to be solvable, doesn't it...?"""

,"With Battler's encouragement, discussions over Bernkastel's mystery game began at each table."
, The mix of humans and fantasy creatures in heated discussion was truly a sight to behold.
, Beato and Bernkastel sat in a chair far off from the discussions.
Ronoue Genji,"""Would you like some tea?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Any kind of calming black tea for me. With milk, if you don't mind."""
Ronoue Genji,"""As you wish. ......Is there anything you need, Lady Bernkastel?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Please add some dried plums to some black tea. ......That's the trick to making terrible tea drinkable."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*! Come now, don't sulk. We're honestly complimenting your game for being such a fun one."""
,"Since she had emerged victorious in the game Bernkastel had put all her heart into, the look on Beato's face made her last line almost sound like an apology."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I'm not sulking. My face just looks this way."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""When I managed to spot Bern's own kind of warmth in that expression, I felt like I'd climbed to the pitch-black top of a snowy mountain to find a beautiful star."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Well, sorry for having an eternally frosty face."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""How difficult it is to compliment Lady Bernkastel. No matter what you say, she always takes it in a bad way."""

{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hohoh, the type who lies in bed thinking about it and hugging her pillow."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Yep, that's Bern for you."""
,Beato and Lambdadelta giggled together. Bernkastel shrugged and looked away...
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Seriously though, this really was a fun, puzzling game."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You think so? ......Thank you."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Even though you could've made it unsolvable, you really did make it to be solved. ......That's not something you can do unless you plan on enjoying a fair game."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I like games where I win no matter what. Games that I might lose are just a pain."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Later, I'd like to switch sides and try another one. I'll make a puzzle, and we'll see if you can solve it. A game for you to win against me."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Of course, I'll use all the know-how I've picked up in my fights with Beato to make it super-hard. I'm not giving up my winning streak that easily...!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........Both you and Beato. ......You have such an interesting way of thinking."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""How's that?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......A game is just a means to decide who wins and who loses, right? When you create one, your own victory should be your highest priority. ......So, why would you go to all the trouble of making a game you might lose...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What fun is there in a game that you always win? That's not even a game."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Victory and defeat. It's fun because you're taking part in a fair competition, balanced between those two outcomes. A game isn't a fight. It's communication. It's the means you have to enjoy. And if you manage to win, well, that's just an added bonus."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Finally. ......Finally, I clearly understand the difference between how all of you think and how I think."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What difference?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""For you, this is communication. ......It isn't for me."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The world you live in must be pretty savage."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............And what about you? ......Wasn't it the same for you, until you understood Beato's game? ......An eternal game is eternal torture. ......Have you already completely forgotten about that pain you suffered...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..................There were days I did think that. ......But now, it's all been resolved. I won't complain about stuff that's in the past. I'm impartial, you might say."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""That......is the critical difference between you and me, I think. ......Your eternal torture was something you could laugh off and forget. ......Mine wasn't nearly so trivial. ......That's all there is to it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I don't know your history. ......It sounds like you had it rough."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Hmph. ......To think I'm getting sympathy from a mere former piece. I must be losing my touch."""
,"Bernkastel, sipping the black tea that Genji had brought her, gazed up at the ceiling with a faraway look."
," Battler may not have known her history, ......but even he was able to understand a bit of how she felt."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Are you  tortured by someone right now?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Are you kidding? ......I'm as free as can be. I'm not bound by anyone's shackles."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then that's a good thing, isn't it? At least things are better for you now."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........True. It's much better now than it once was. ......Though I am on this long, endless journey to escape from boredom."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Then, at the very least, meeting up here should have been a good thing for you."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Indeed. ......Even the taste of defeat has driven boredom away from me for a time."""
,"No, no. Battler was shaking his head and laughing."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......We're friends who've enjoyed fighting in a fair game."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""So.........?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""If your days are filled with nothing except running away from boredom, ......feel free to drop by our place every now and then. We'd love to welcome a friend. And we'll be able to set up everything needed to help a friend escape from boredom."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You think you can prepare a welcome interesting enough to help me, the great Bernkastel, escape boredom for even a night...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I do. That's what it means to be a friend."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""We won tonight's game. So, the next time you come, we'll switch sides. This time, we'll entertain you with one of our games."
Ushiromiya Battler," ......Of course, we don't intend to let you win easily. We'll challenge you to a devilishly twisted logic game! It won't be something you can solve in a night. It'll be good enough to make you stay for months, wracking your brains over it."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......You would entertain me, the great Bernkastel, as a friend......?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, we would."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Hmph...... ......After talking with you, even this dried plum tea is starting to taste sickly sweet. What a pain."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I heard from Beato. Sounds like this dried plum tea stuff is one of your favorites. Next time, we'll toss some high-class dried plums covered in gold leaf into your tea, so make sure you come again."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......If you really plan to do that, try finding some better tea to start with. I'll never feel like coming again if you keep serving tea like this."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Ah, come on. Guess you drink high-grade black tea all the time. In fact, next time, why don't you invite us to somewhere we can drink some of this high-quality tea?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........Me......invite you? .........*giggle*......ahahahahaha."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""It's only fair, right? We've treated you. Now it's your turn."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yes, it would be only fair."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""So, let's have the game be fair too. Let's switch sides and start a new game. I'm looking forward to it. We won this time, but who knows about the next...?!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......That's some confidence you have there. And yet, I'm afraid you're mistaken on one point."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What's that?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""My game isn't over yet. ......I wonder who will win in the end."""
,"After taking one more sip of her black tea, Bernkastel set her cup on the table, wearing a thin smile."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......The tea here's far too sweet. It was a mistake to have any. ......Thank you, Genji. Take this away, please."""
Ronoue Genji,"""As you wish......"""
,Bernkastel asked for her tea to be taken away after taking only two sips.
," Battler smiled, realizing that this was just Bern's way of being shy."
,............
," Battler. ......Why are you smiling with such a foolish, optimistic face...? "
,If you really think this final game will be nothing but a happy epilogue...
, Then I'll have to invite you all to a proper game for bringing this tale to a close.
, Battler. You forget things too easily.
, Don't you remember in whose hands lie the key to this final game......? 
,The inside of my nose itched.
, I've never regained consciousness to a smell before.
," Slowly, I opened my eyes."
,"......Wait, when did I lose consciousness in the first place? "
,I don't remember going to sleep or falling unconscious.
, That's right. ......Bernkastel invited me to come to a place better for drinking tea......
,"......That's when my memory gets hazy. And, since the smell of black tea is what woke me up..."
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Where am I......?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Auaurora's study. ......I hate to admit it, but her taste in tea really is excellent."""
,I was sitting on what appeared to be a sofa in a dimly lit study.
," Bernkastel sat across from me. ......And, right before my eyes, was a beautiful cup filled with hot, steaming tea."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Isn't......this place......"""
,I remembered. I've been here before. ......Wasn't it......
,"{a:c: ""How pleasant it is to see you again, child of man.""}"
,"......Yes, that voice. Just hearing it brings back memories."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Long time no see, ......my master."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""I didn't think I would get the chance to welcome you into my study again. ......To think that that game of yours is still continuing."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......It won't be continuing much longer. This is the end, the true final game."""
,This was the study of Featherine Augustus Aurora.
," The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating."
,"......Once in the past, I was summoned by her and ordered to be her Reader, or miko."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Don't tell me you want me to Read again..."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""I wasn't the one who called you here. ......My miko brought the two of us together."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""For what reason...?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Isn't it obvious? ......To show you the path that leads to the truth."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""You'll show me the way, Featherine?"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""......I am the Witch of Theatergoing. ......Though I dislike interfering with the actors on the stage."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""So, between Battler's boring play and my exciting one that manipulates the branches of fate, which would you rather watch? ......I know you can't stand even a minute of boredom."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Pft, ......heheheheheheheh."""
,"As Featherine rocked her rocking chair, she looked up at the ceiling and chuckled."
, She clearly holds some key to the truth I seek.
{f:5:Featherine},"""......And yet, you are literally the one holding the key. ......I can do nothing but tell you where to find the keyhole. Child of man."""
,"I don't remember saying anything out loud, but Featherine answered my question as though I had."
,"......Come to think of it, that's right."
, Featherine can read the thoughts of a mere child of man like me as easily as she can hear me speak.
," Well, I guess that'll help us get to the point quicker..."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Onii-chan gave me this key. Still, he just said something about how I'd know how to use it when the time was right. He didn't say a word about what it was used for. ......Do you two know? What is this key for? Onii-chan said it was something very precious."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Explain, my miko."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""No way. You explain."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""......You demand that your master explain?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""You've got to participate on the stage every now and then. Otherwise you'll just go senile all the faster."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""My, my...... And yet, the memory of my long-overdue appearance on the stage when Ange was Reader should have been enough to last me a few more centuries."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Tell me. ......What is this key?"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""A physical manifestation of the decision you are to make. ......This tale, this game......will end by asking you to make a certain decision. What you hold there is the act of your decision embodied in the form of a key."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""The physical manifestation......of my decision......"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Exactly. At the end, Battler was probably planning to put you in front of two doors, both of which can be opened by the key. Then, he would ask you to choose which door to open. He must have told you that much, right?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........He didn't tell me anything at all. He just kept saying things like 'you'll know when the time comes'. ......No one will tell me anything. Not Onii-chan, not anyone..."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Battler probably wants to respect a decision that you make by your own free will."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""But Ange. ......You should've at least started to figure it out by now, right?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Figure what out?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""There's an answer Battler wants you to choose, right......?"""
,Those words......made my heart jump in my chest.
,......It was what I had been thinking.
," Onii-chan is clearly trying to trick me with a vague tale, almost like a daydream, that'll take me even farther away from the truth."
, At the 1986 family conference...
, Everyone had a wonderful time as they faded away.
," Everyone is smiling down on you from heaven, so you don't need to feel alone, even in 1998. So give it your all and live on by yourself."
,......I've clearly felt Onii-chan's intention to end it like that.
," And every time I asked him about it, he'd dodge the issue and say something about how the decision would be mine in the end."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""That's right. It may appear that Battler is giving you a fair choice, ......but he's actually scheming to get you to choose one of the two answers. ......You've already seen the farce of a tale that he's using to do that, right?"""
,......That bizarre Halloween party.
, Everyone so strange and friendly that it was almost sickening.
," I've already seen more than enough of that tale, so sickly sweet it makes me want to vomit, where Ushiromiya Kinzo showered me with affection, where his children swore to support each other, ......where everyone was filled with happiness and hope."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......He's trying to trick me with those chummy scenes......so he can keep me away from the truth. ......He's such a...coward..."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Certainly, he might be called a coward from your perspective. But remember. If you are a player in this game and Battler is the Game Master, ......what does that mean?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""In the past, Battler was a player and Beato was the Game Master. And they each fought for their own respective truths. ......So, what is it this time?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I'm a player......and Onii-chan's the Game Master."""
,Could it be......that I've misunderstood everything from the very beginning? 
,"Onii-chan said he'd tell me what happened that day, ......so I was under the impression that I'd learn everything if I followed him."
,"......How would that be any different than, say, Onii-chan accepting everything Beato said about the crimes being the work of a witch? "
,What......a stupid mistake I've been making......
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......This game......has always been a fight between me and Onii-chan......?"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""I'm surprised you participated in the game without realizing that."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Battler really is sly. He just started up the final game without letting you realize that simple fact. ......Well, it was the same back in Beato's games. Battler was drawn into her game before he knew what was happening. Before he even knew how to fight. ......That's why I taught him how."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""And now, it's exactly the same. ......You were forced to start this game before you understood anything about it, and I've come to tell you the truth. To tell you who you're fighting against, and for what."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""............"""
,I was......too shocked to speak.
," And finally, ......I realized what I needed to accomplish in this game."
, I've always been passive.
," I was sure that Onii-chan would tell me everything, so I naively thought I just had to believe whatever he said......"
Ushiromiya Ange,"""No. ......That was wrong."""
,"This is a battle......between me, the one who wants to reach the truth, ......and Onii-chan, who wants to trick me and chase me out into a 1998 where I'm all alone..."
," All this time, ......I've kept on saying that Onii-chan was foolish and naive, ......and now I see that I was more naive than anyone else..."
," And yet, Bernkastel didn't sneer at me."
," On the contrary, ......she looked at me with that cold gaze, as if to say 'so you've finally taken the first step'."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Now do you understand? Your own purpose......and the purpose of that key."""
,"I gripped the key that Onii-chan had hung around my neck... and for a while, I shook with an emotion that even I couldn't understand."
," Now that I know Onii-chan tricked me, it would be easy to hate him. But hating him would be missing the point."
," After all, ......this is a game between me and him."
, Onii-chan has done nothing but make the optimal moves to win against me.
,"......If games aren't just a playful way to communicate, ......if they're the process that decides who wins and who loses..."
, Then there can be no fair games.
," The best strategy is always to trick your enemy into defeat without telling them the rules, before they even know what's going on......"
,"......In that sense, ......Onii-chan hasn't done anything wrong."
, He's......using that sickly sweet illusion to trick me...and force me out into a lonely future......
," They'll be the only ones having a good time in the cat box, and I'll be the only one chased out."
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Thank you. ......I'm grateful. I think I've finally been able to truly open my eyes."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Please, don't hate Battler. After all, one-sidedly tricking the opponent is what Game Masters do."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......I know. Onii-chan took the best option from his position. That's all there is to it. .........So, I need to make the best possible moves from my position."""
,My goal is now clear.
," October 4th and 5th, 1986. What happened on Rokkenjima that day."
," I need to tear off the veil covering the truth. Nothing more, nothing less."
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Onii-chan gave me this key......probably because he wants me to put it into the keyhole of his choosing. ......That's why he keeps showing me this sentimental illusion. But I won't be fooled anymore. ......I'll open the door I want to open."""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Certainly, this is more my kind of tale than one with an Ange who does whatever Battler says."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""So, this time I'll let you take over the rest. ......Tell Ange. Tell her where the keyhole that leads to the truth is."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Tell me. Where is the keyhole?!"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""......Very well. First off, have a seat. I'll bring it over right now."""
,"When Featherine rose from her rocking chair, ......my vision seemed to twist and bend."
,......What? Some kind of interference? 
,"Why now, when Featherine's about to show me something important... ......Why is my head getting...suddenly......"
," I dug my fingernails into my knees, clenching my teeth to keep from losing consciousness."
," However, ......the world just kept twisting more and more......"
," Except for the feel of the sofa beneath me, I couldn't sense anything at all......"
Amakusa Juuza,"""Lady?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Huh?"""
Amakusa Juuza,"""It looks like she's here."""
,The door opened......and Hachijo Tohya appeared.
,......What's going on? 
,This isn't the world of witches......but the world of humans...? 
,I was sitting on the sofa...and Amakusa was behind me.
,.....................There's no need to feel confused.
, Featherine and Hachijo Tohya are the same being.
," To her, the difference between the two worlds is a trivial thing."
," To put it in the words of that lover of theatergoing, ......it's like having a slightly different background behind the stage."
," So, there was no reason for me to feel hesitant."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Should I call you Hachijo this time?"""
Hachijo Tohya,"""How complicated names are. ......Even though both of us are still here, just like before, you have to wonder what to call me."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......True. Calling you Featherine would be a bit rude to you now. ......For an actor, the name of the role they act is only temporary."""
Hachijo Tohya,"""Precisely, child of man."""
Amakusa Juuza,"""Featherine??"""
,Amakusa's eyes went wide as he wondered what I was suddenly talking about. I ignored him and continued.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......So, what are you going to show me?"""
,"As I spoke, my eyes were caught by that heavy-looking object she held under her arm."
," At a glance, it looked like an encyclopedia with a fancy binding..."
Hachijo Tohya,"""Do you know what this is?"""
,"As Featherine spoke, she set the heavy object on the table."
, My first thought......was of a grimoire.
," The heavy book had a mysterious, mystical feel to it, like something Maria onee-chan might carry around."
," And the most remarkable feature of it......was the large, sturdy lock that held it shut."
, Why would someone go so far to keep people from reading a book......?
Hachijo Tohya,"""Why don't you take it and observe the back?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........The back...?"""
,I flipped the heavy book over on my lap.
," And, as soon as I saw it, I gave a small gasp."
Ushiromiya Ange,""".........Eva... ...Ushiro......Ushiromiya... ......Ushiromiya Eva."""
,"Without a doubt, those words were written there with the letters of the alphabet."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What is this...? Eva oba-san's......diary...?"""
Amakusa Juuza,"""Could this be......that rumored..."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Do you know something about this...?!"""
Amakusa Juuza,"""Just a rumor. ......They say that President Eva had a secret diary, and that she always kept it locked up. ......They say she took it with her everywhere she went. At least, that's what I heard from some of the other bodyguards."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......A secret...diary... And why is that here......?"""
Hachijo Tohya,"""It was in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva passed away."""
,This diary was hidden behind her bed.
," So, it remained in that room for some time after her death before it was found."
," Then, by coincidence, it was probably found by someone who worked for the hospital, or else a patient or their family."
,"......Of course, by that time, there was a huge movement dedicated to the Rokkenjima mystery."
, A locked diary found in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva spent her last moments......would be absolutely priceless.
," The discoverer probably handed it over in secret to one of the 'Witch Hunters', who would be able to accurately determine its worth."
," Luckily, the Witch Hunters who got their hands on this book were all noble and upright people."
," Not content to boorishly destroy the lock and reveal the truth, ......they simply satisfied themselves with the fact that the truth of that day slumbered just on the other side of this mysterious lock."
," Thanks to that, ......Eva's diary has remained undamaged to this very day..."
Hachijo Tohya,"""It is already known that Natsuhi, wife of Krauss, the oldest son of Kinzo, sealed all of her complaints and repressed feelings by writing them down in a diary, which she treated like a sort of charm."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......So, Eva oba-san did the same thing?"""
Amakusa Juuza,"""It's possible, at least. ......Unlocking the hinges of this diary would be a pain, even if you had a key. It's sealed up tight like a corset."""
,Amakusa was right.
, This wasn't a diary made to be casually opened and reminisced over.
,"......It's probably safe to assume that this diary was used to forget things by writing them down and sealing them away, just like Ushiromiya Natsuhi's."
," And on top of that, Eva brought it with her into her hospital room, then hid it behind the bed without telling anyone about it..."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......Don't tell me that diary... ......Are you saying Eva oba-san wrote down what happened that day...?"""
Hachijo Tohya,"""By reading its contents, you will probably learn everything. ......However, we don't know where the key that unlocks it is."""
,I jumped.
," Then, I looked down at my chest. That's where my brother hung that key......"
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Huh? I, ......it's gone! Th, ......the key's gone...!"""
Amakusa Juuza,"""......What's wrong, Lady? What key?"""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""It's been hanging from my neck the whole time, hasn't it?!"""
Amakusa Juuza,"""......I never noticed it. You had a key hanging from your neck...?"""
,I understood almost immediately.
," In the world of humans, I haven't found the key."
, The 'me' with the key......is on the game board in the world of witches.
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Make me the 'me' with the key! I'm going to unlock this diary."""
,"Featherine lifted a finger, spun it around, and the world twisted again."
," When I returned to Featherine's study, the key popped back into existence, hanging from my neck."
," But at the same time, ......the diary on my lap popped out of existence."
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Where'd the diary go?!"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""It should exist somewhere on the game board. Since it is one of the keyholes you are to be given, it must exist somewhere."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""Did Onii-chan hide it somewhere...?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Since Battler is trying to make this a game between you and him, it probably isn't completely hidden."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""What do you mean...?"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Even if Battler thinks of it as a king that mustn't be taken, there would be no game unless it existed somewhere on this board."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""In other words, ......it's somewhere in the Ushiromiya mansion...?"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""Or, you may already have been given an opportunity to witness it. ......Like how a swindler has already hidden a trap in microscopic letters on the first page of a contract you sign."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......If Battler follows the rules of mystery as the Game Master, .........'clues must be shown', so the choice that leads to Battler's defeat must have been shown."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," ......Ange. Try and remember. ......You should have seen Eva's diary already in Battler's world."""
,"In that instant, ......from the back of my mind.........drifted the very first scene of this final game."
, In the chapel...
,"......A book lying on the altar, a book with a lock on it......"
," As soon as I showed interest in that book, ......Battler suddenly got serious and told me not to touch it......"
Ushiromiya Ange,"""That......was Eva oba-san's diary......"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""That's right. Ushiromiya Eva's diary. The Book of the Single Truth, with the truth of that day written inside it."""
Ushiromiya Ange,"""......The Book...of the Single Truth... And is the truth really written inside it? After all, there's a chance that it's just something Eva oba-san-"""
{f:5:Featherine},"""I'll give it to you in red. ......{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva's diary, the Book of the Single Truth, has written within it the truth of Rokkenjima during October 4th and 5th, 1986.}"""
