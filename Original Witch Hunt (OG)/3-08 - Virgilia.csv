Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
,"There was no way to notice the coming of morning without opening a window and looking at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter."
," It wasn't a refreshing morning. All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which had kept falling since last night, and the howl of the wind..."
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......It's hard to imagine that it's morning. This horrible weather reflects our hearts."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Then isn't that pretty gentle? At least falling rain is better than falling spears."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Wahhaha. Whether it's rain or spears, it's comin' down with a bang. "
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,".........Is it already 6:00? Fuaaaaaa... Isn't this enough? After this, we've got no measures we can take until the mystery 19th person, Beatrice, takes action."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""That is correct. ......However, I believe we have thought of every trick they could use against us."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""That's right. As long as a traitor doesn't appear amid the siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......Haven't we talked about this enough? We've stayed up all night. ...I'm tired."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""You're right. How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""...A good plan. Staying up all night is trying at our age."""
,"As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I'll go wash my face or something. We probably look horrible."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...............? What is that horrible stench?"""
,"As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie openly made a disgusted expression."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...What happened?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""Hey, don't you smell something awful...?"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,""".........Hm. ...What is this stench? I can't stand it..."""
,"Because of that disturbance, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor....It was a faint stench, but after Kyrie had started complaining about the stink, they clearly noticed it."
," Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from..."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""What in the world could it be? Let us have Genji deal with it. I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Hmm, please. It is at least difficult to imagine that Gohda would make a breakfast that would cause this kind of stench..."""
,"Rudolf and the others searched for the source of the smell, and determined that it was coming from underground, from the boiler room."
," But the door was locked, and they couldn't check inside."
," On the other side of things, as Natsuhi and the rest were on their way to search for someone in the servant room, they noticed something strange about the parlor."
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......What is this...?!"""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I, it's a horrible prank... Who would do something like..."""
,"On the door to the parlor, in a paint that reminded one of blood, there was a strange..., thing like a magic circle drawn."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""No one has come to the kitchen yet. ......Wh, what is, that?"""
,"Eva's group, who had thought the smell had been coming from the kitchen, had returned after checking that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun."
,......And they had noticed something unusual about the parlor.
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""It's useless, the boiler room is locked. Wouldn't it be bad if something's broken down in the boiler room? Is there a servant anywhere around here?"""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,""".........! Is that vulgar scribble here too? There was also one on the door to the boiler room."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""What's that?! This creepy scribble isn't just here, but it's in other places as well?! Haha, you don't think that this is the witch of the forest Beatrice's declaration of war, right?"""
,"Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like it was a message from a witch."
,"...The dripping bright-red paint made one think of blood, and it made things even more creepy."
," Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it had been locked."
,"...As a general rule, the parlor wasn't locked. Someone had gone out of their way to lock it."
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......What does this mean...? Could it be that, while we were talking in the dining hall, someone secretly left this scribble? On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...I'm sure the servants are behind this. We were together the whole time. We all have alibis. ......They probably received some strange order from Father, and did this prank."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,""".........Including the case yesterday with Maria-chan's letter. It is very easy to suspect that the servants are acting on Father's orders and planning something. ......Anyway, where is everyone? They can't be playing hide and seek. Let's look for them."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""B, ...before that, I'm worried about the children. They're alright, aren't they? I'll go and check, and while I'm there, I'll see if there aren't any servants there."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Then let's split up. While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we'll investigate inside the mansion..........I don't want to think about it, but maybe these creepy magic circles aren't just where we've found them."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""......We might be wrapped up in Father's bizarre game. ...I will go to him and hear the situation. ......Well, I don't think he will obediently listen to me though."""
,The adults split up.
," As a result, they made sure that four children were safe in what they were calling the cousins room, on the second floor of the guesthouse."
," It appeared that they had stayed up late last night playing. All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them."
," Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also alright. It seemed he believed in the phrase 'early to bed, early to rise', and had awoken refreshed."
," During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants. But they didn't find them."
,...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""......The children are alright. All of them stayed up too late last night."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""The servant room is empty. I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin' shift begins at 6:00. They should have started workin' by now..."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""The nap room is also empty. There were signs that a futon had been taken out, but it wasn't warm."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Hey, ...isn't your reasonin' right on this? ......This is probably a game planned on Father's orders. Surely, he left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere, trying to make us do somethin'."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......Are you saying that he's trying to see who is fit to succeed his wealth and inheritance? ...Isn't that a bit..."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""No......It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""After all, Father loves big tricks. ......This might have been a polished plan since that epitaph was hung in the hall."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""...In that case, I wonder whether they will make an announcement of the game or an explanation for it. ......Although it would be nice if an envelope with the crest, like the one handed to Maria-chan, were to appear."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""............That's right. Maybe Nii-san and the rest have found that in the mansion."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Doctor Nanjo. Have you heard anythin'?"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......M, my apologies, I do not have any idea what is going on. And yet, ......yes, I see, I could easily imagine that Kinzo-san is planning something big."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""...Shouldn't we go back to the mansion for now? Maybe they found somethin' over there."""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""If I will not be in the way, I will go too."""
Ushiromiya Rosa,"""I, I'll stay here. ...The children are sleeping upstairs. We don't know what is happening. We cannot leave them alone."""
Ushiromiya Kyrie,"""......That's right. I'll stay with Rosa-san and watch over the place. Would you tell that to my husband?"""
,"Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse. Hideyoshi went with Nanjo, and returned again to the mansion."
," On the other side, in the mansion..."
," In a way that was hard to believe, ...or maybe we should say in a way that gave him a bad feeling..."
, Rudolf's prediction was right on.
,...Because the same magic circle scribble that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor had been found in multiple places throughout the mansion.
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Aniki...! How's Father?"""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""No, it was useless. There was no response. I tried putting my ear against the door, but I couldn't sense anyone."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""...I cannot find the servants anywhere. ...Where in the world did they disappear off to..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""This isn't funny. Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion. ......What in the world is happening...?!"""
,"There weren't only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor. There were two on the second floor, and one on the third floor, for a total of five."
," They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors were locked, so they couldn't check inside."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""...Anyway, let's do something about the boiler room first. It would be bad if something broke down and caught fire or exploded. ...So we need the key."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""It should be in the key box in the servant room."""
,They fished through the key box in the servant room.
," Because each of the servants carried their master keys around, those weren't kept here."
," However, all of the individual keys should have been kept here."
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""............It's so packed with keys."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...It isn't here. No matter how much we look, we won't find the key to the boiler room."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Look, Aneki. ......Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them, aren't here at all."""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""......It's true. ...How troublesome......"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""It's as though someone didn't want us to go in the rooms with the magic circles. ......No, they went to all the trouble of making those magic circles obvious, so they wanted us to enter...?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""I think it's the latter. ...This isn't a movie, so breaking down the door is probably impossible. It might work if we smash a window."""
,Krauss had a little trouble deciding whether this was a situation that called for smashing a window.
," At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned. There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe. They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place."
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Good morning. ...I heard that something strange has happened."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Good morning, Doctor Nanjo. ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""What is it? Did you find a letter or somethin'? I was sure you would have found somethin' like that by now..."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......You're right. I also believe that this is a massive joke or game of Father's... But if that was the case, there should be some letter telling us about that. Like the letter that was given to Maria-chan."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""What if the announcement of the game actually was Maria-chan's letter? The details of the game, 'try solving the riddle of the epitaph', have already been shown."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""Then, what could the five magic circles we found in the mansion mean? ...And the missing servants."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""......Natsuhi nee-san. How many servants were there total today...?"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Huh? .........Genji, Gohda, ......five of them, but why?"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""......So, there are five servants. There are also five magic circles. ......It may be a coincidence, but it worries me."""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""...Nii-san. Let's break a window. We should check and see what's inside."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,"""............We have no choice. Do it neatly."""
,"Krauss made his decision, and gave permission to smash a window."
," And he decided that the first room they would break into would be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach."
," They had hoped to peek in through the window, but the curtains were down, so they couldn't see inside."
," Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the window."
," Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist, and came back."
Ushiromiya Eva,"""You don't have to smash the whole thing. Just open it enough so that you can reach the lock."""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Don't get your hopes up, alright?"""
,"Rudolf raised the rock, and hit the glass with it several times."
," Eventually, he succeeded in opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside."
,"...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole, and cautiously unlocked it."
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""We should probably cover it with packing tape later. The rain'll get blown in."""
,"When he suddenly opened the window, the wind and rain made the curtain dance around violently. The curtain was blown to the side."
,...They could see the parlor they knew well.
," They were a little relieved.......Because they had thought that maybe, there would be another bizarre magic circle inside the room, or possibly the traces of some creepy ceremony."
," In any event, they didn't want to hang around out in the rain, so six people: Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo, entered the parlor as a group."
Nanjo Terumasa,"""......It seems, ...that nothing in particular has changed..."""
Ushiromiya Krauss,""".........Mu-"""
Ushiromiya Natsuhi,"""Wh, what has happened, Shannon...?!"""
Ushiromiya Eva,"""Wait, wait, are you alright?! What happened to you?!"""
Ushiromiya Hideyoshi,"""Blood, blood!! D, D, Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"""
Ushiromiya Rudolf,"""Hey, Shannon-chan! Are you okay?! Answer me!"""
Nanjo Terumasa,"""Y, you mustn't shake her... I will examine her condition now..."""
,"She had been in the shadow of the sofa, so they hadn't noticed her until they had entered the room."
," Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright-red with blood......"
{f:5:Beatrice},"""He~~y, Battleeer, where are yoooou? Look, look, Shannon's corpse has turned up, see~~~? I won't bully you anymore, so come out."
{f:5:Beatrice},"......Hmmmm? Oh, there you are. What are you doing, holding your head in a place like that?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................"""
,"Battler was crouching under the table, holding his head... His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn't want to see anything, didn't want to hear anything..."
, Had he heard Beatrice's sneering voice?
,"...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn't hear? In any event, it was clear that he had closed up his heart like a shell..."
Ronove,"""Pu ku ku ku.........I wonder if you have tormented him too much, Milady. After showing him that much and demanding a counterargument, I can understand why he wants to mope around."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hey, Battleer. If you can't argue back, resign, alright? It's your turn. If you don't make some move or pass, or else give up, we won't get anywhere."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................et."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Huh? What's that? I can't hear you?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""I said be quiet!! Aaaah, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuup!! A witch? Magic?! Can't you just do what you want, I don't believe, I don't believe any of it, damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Don't talk to me, don't show me anything, disappear, disappear, just disappear!! Don't get that annoying face near meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""..................!"""
,"Without thinking, Beatrice winced at Battler's sudden rage."
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......E, even if you say that... If you don't finish your turn, then my turn won't come. I'm trying to say that I don't want you to bore me but..."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Who cares, be quiet, shut uuup!! Who cares about your game, I won't go along with iiiiit!! If your turn won't come until mine is finished, then just wait for all eternity!!"
Ushiromiya Battler," Aaaah, I don't know I don't know I don't get it!! I won't accept witches or magic, I won't accept something that screwed up!! Uuooooooooooohhh, I said don't talk to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"""
,"......I don't know what's what anymore. After being shown something that screwed up, how could I resist..."
, I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.
,"......It was raining and windy, but that didn't mean my body got wet....There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............Maybe, ...I lost to that person's game a long time ago."""
,"...Actually, in the last game, I wonder whether we hadn't reached a clear resolution."
," After all, I had surrendered for a time. So the world had been tinted with witches and magic."
,"......Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange magic."
,...It isn't a matter of accepting it or denying it.
, Maybe I had mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.
," I had already been defeated in the last game, ...and this may just be the signing ceremony of my surrender."
," Just now, a terrible battle had unfolded in this rose garden. I had seen it with my own eyes."
," I kicked the ground. ......Obviously, the ground was hard. And a puddle splashed."
," Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high-rise buildings."
,"......The more I kicked this ground, .........the more it felt like that really couldn't be possible."
," But, because of that, I couldn't explain it with anything other than magic anymore......"
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......A closed room with the key shut up inside. That one again. I know that that's often used to prolong detective novels.......But, ......still... That big flashy thing....... Damn it........."""
,"""............It seems that my disciple has caused you much trouble."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...Huh? .........It's you..."""
,"I was suddenly spoken to, so I turned around, ...and in the rose garden arbor, ......was the Predecessor Beatrice, who Beatrice had supposedly defeated a short while ago."
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........I was sure you'd died. So, you were alive."""
,"""No, I died. ...Now, I am nothing more than a defeated chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""You're Beato's teacher, right? So, in other words, you're a witch too."""
,"""......Yes, that is correct."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Heh. So, in other words, ......that means witches really do exist? And I'm not the one who can defeat her. That'd be you, since you can use awesome magic, wouldn't it? ...I'm just useless now. There's nothing I can do anymore..."""
,"""............Oh, my. Have you surrendered completely?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What do you mean, surrender?! How should I explain that?! Towers sprouting and falling!! Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel weird, now even reasoning's useless, isn't it?!! We've left the level of tricks and explanations with human culprits!! Aaaaaaaaaaahh, damn it damn it damn it damn it!!"""
,"""Calm yourself. ......I am nothing more than a piece on that child's game board. After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being who can do anything. "
,"But you are that child's opponent. Because as long as you do not give up by yourself, you will always have the power to strike back at that child."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Shut up! Weren't you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!! "
Ushiromiya Battler,"What do you mean, strike back?! Are you saying you'll teach me magic too, and make me take part in that massive magic battle?!!"""
,"""......If you wish, I could teach you a bit about magic."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Oh, just what I wanted! Please, give me some awesome magic to smash her chest in one blow...!! Hah, don't screw with me!"""
,"""I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony to pray for rain. Do you know of it?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Rain ceremony? That thing where you throw stuff into the fire and offer a dance? ......That's not magic. They say that the fire causes an updraft, and as a result, rain clouds gather. That's supposed to be an accepted scientific phenomenon."""
,"""Oh? ...I had believed that it was a form of eastern magic, but it isn't magic? I had believed that people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect, so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Maybe people did that long ago. But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."""
,"""Why do things burn? Isn't that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......No, things burn because of a chemical reaction. Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."""
,"""Why does heat transfer through objects? Isn't that because caloric is contained in the material?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...I'm pretty sure that was abolished by Joule. Heat is energy, not a substance."""
,"""You have studied well. Your knowledge is correct."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...It's just some random facts."""
,"""Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and god's love. ......All are powerless before a scientific explanation. In the past, I was told that an apple falling from a tree was thanks to god's love, so that humans would be given food."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""The love of god instead of gravity? ...Well, that's probably the remnants from the period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."""
,"""That is correct. In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge, ......no, ignorance itself, magic. ...Just like the rain ceremony we were just talking about."
," Did the people of ancient times realize that there was a scientific explanation, that fire gave rise to heat to cause updrafts which called clouds? Even without understanding, they at least knew of the result."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......That probably happened a lot. That thing called knowledge of the ancestors. Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they would achieve a result. ...Phenomena whose principles they didn't understand were probably the same as magic to them."""
,"Just like this person had just said, ancient people who didn't understand the principles had probably believed that, through the rain ceremony, their wish would reach the heavens and make rain fall."
," To them, that was certainly magic. As long as they didn't understand updrafts..."
,"""If you push an electrical switch, a light turns on. ......Children do not know the scientific principles behind why a lightbulb lights up, they only know the result when they push the switch. If they obtain a result without knowing the principles, isn't that magic to them?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............That's pretty interesting. ...Well, logically, that's true. ...For example, I don't have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture."
Ushiromiya Battler," However, I think it's completely normal to see things shown on a TV. Even if I don't understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that 'if I push the switch I can watch TV'."
Ushiromiya Battler," ...It's exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding updrafts. ......In other words, if I don't know the principles, even TV is the same as magic, no, could you say it is magic?"""
,"""Do you know how Braun tubes are constructed? Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Nope. I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn't have a clue. I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."""
,"""That book was a fake. Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes, and they do their job with magic."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Huh?! That's stupid, there's no way...!"""
,"""How can you deny it if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I've never looked inside, but I can state that small people like that definitely don't exist!"""
,"""Since there is no Braun tube here, that is impossible to prove."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Y, yeah, it is impossible to prove right now, ...but later I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"""
,"""So, in other words, my 'magic theory', that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic, is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, right?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........Erk, .........what the hell, one of those? Are you trying to say it's a 'Devil's Proof'? That's your favorite trick, you witches."""
,"""A 'Devil's Proof' is a form of underhanded sophistry formed by claiming that it is impossible to prove a negative fact. However, it is different from what I am talking about with Braun tubes. That could be resolved just by taking apart a single television."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......You're right. It really isn't a 'Devil's Proof'."""
,"""The scientific theory you propose, and the magical theory I propose. ...One of those is the truth. And which one it is can be ascertained as soon as you look inside the Braun tube. However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other's theories."
," So while there is only one truth, until you look into the Braun tube, you can make two conflicting truths exist at the same time. ......A different universe where, in a case that only one truth must exist, two can exist at the same time."""
,"Is the cat in the box alive or dead? If you open the box, you will know the answer. You will know the truth."
," However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim it is dead."
," Each of the two parties make a claim that is the 'correct' truth, and even though the two sides are conflicting, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened."
," In other words, two truths exist at the same time."
," Even though there can only be one cat in the box, it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, in a strange parallel world."
, That is what Rokkenjima is now.
,......This island is now a different world where a science theory and a magic theory exist at the same time.
,"...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself, at a glance, it may feel as though this island had been sucked into a world of magic."
," While that may be correct, it is not accurate."
," Strictly speaking, it has been moved from the world of science to the gap between that world and the world of magic."
," So at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magic side."
,"......But actually, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to the two opposing worlds."
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......I don't really get it... The gap between reality and magic? A perfectly impartial world? How's that? Hasn't everything been going really bad for me the whole time...?!"""
,"""Then perhaps you could think of it this way. This is a trial. Think of it as a court where you and Beatrice are laying out opposing claims. It's like a Braun tube trial."
," That child claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes. And she explains one thing after another, talking about the lives of the tiny people, what they look like, what type of magical power they have. ......And you?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Well, I study in a library, and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed."""
,"""At that moment, both your claim and that child's claim exist in the court at the same time. ......If you listen to that child's claim, you may hear it as though it were the truth. See it as though it were the truth. You truly were shown that."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""........................"""
,"""At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly might exist as truth. ...However, until the moment that the cat's box is opened, that world is an uncertain wave function. The entire situation can be explained by both sides at the same time. However, there is one truth."
," That truth is contracted by observation, and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth. It is like when, in court, the judge makes his judgement. The two truths from the prosecutor's and the defense's claims, are contracted by the judgement, and become one."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........To say it in your words, ......this island right now is the world right before looking into the Braun tube, right...? Therefore, the science theory and the magic theory cannot be denied. And since they cannot be denied, """
,"""Both can exist as truth. Therefore, both witches and magic can exist. ...However, at the same time, your opinion which denies that also exists as truth."
,".........It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at the same time. And, it is a world where the conflicting truths cannot disprove each other. .........Have you been able to understand...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""..................In other words, ......no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me, ...that is only a claim from the 'magic theory', and it doesn't disprove mine."
Ushiromiya Battler," So, 'no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me, in this world, that cannot become proof that magic exists'."""
,"""That's right. That child will probably even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic. That child might shake her staff and pluck the apple with magic, and claim that she dropped it to the earth."
," However, that would be nothing more than another one of her claims. None of her claims can block your opportunity to make a claim. ......In that sense, this world is quite 'impartial' to both sides."""
Ushiromiya Battler,""".........I, get it.........Still. By that argument, if I show a sound argument with my 'science theory', and it collides head on with her 'magic theory', I also cannot win against her. Furthermore, the final judgement won't come until we peek into the Braun tube."
Ushiromiya Battler,.........Where is the Braun tube in this world? ...It means there's no reason for us to argue. ......Wouldn't it be alright if we just got along and peeked into the Braun tube? 
Ushiromiya Battler,"If there really is a tiny person in there, it's my complete loss. Otherwise, it's my victory. ......Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"""
,"""That itself is the 'game' which that child has challenged you to. Maybe, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example. Victory and loss is not determined by a judge. You who are fighting will decide it yourselves."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed up world where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"""
,"""In actuality, did you lose the argument, and surrender like this...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""...............Heh. ...Heheheh."""
,"""That is all the advice I can give you now. If you wish, I can occasionally give you advice."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Sure. Thanks, that really helps. ......I'll avenge you."""
,"""Hoh-hoh-ho, thank you. I am looking forward to it."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""What's your name?"""
,"""...Beatrice used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name. "
,".........So, I shall take a temporary name. ......Virgilius. ...No, what about Virgilia?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Virgilia. {c:86EF9C:Valkyria}? Wasn't that the name of a legendary goddess?"""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""No. It means the one who is a guide to Beatrice. ......I will guide you to that child who waits at the summit of the Mount Purgatory. It should be a fitting name for that kind of guide."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""To think that I'd accept help from a witch when I'm trying to deny witches. ......I see. If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, that also works. ...Ihihi, it's almost funny."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""I am borrowing that child's words, but you truly are like a phoenix. ......Your will to fight has already been revived."
{f:5:Virgilia}," ...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to that child, ......return to the chessboard that child is sitting at. ......I look forward to seeing how far you can fight my disciple."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Yeah, watch it. ............I won't listen to her babbling anymore. I'll cooly fight to the end. I definitely won't get provoked by her anymore."""
{f:5:Virgilia},"""Then let us return. To the seat of the battle."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...Oh, ......oooh, Battler...! Where did you hide yourself? *cackle*! I thought the sore loser wouldn't show himself again, you see?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......Sorry to keep you waiting. I've cooled my head a little."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""And? Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Teacher and meeeeeeee? Isn't that impossible to explain without fantasy? Hihhyahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah?!"""
Ronove,"""...Milady. Didn't you just promise to be kind and act refined?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Ahhyahahahahaha, oh no, oh no. I just got in such a good mood when I saw Battler's face, you see? Look look look, so Battler, that battle just now, how will you respond to it? Hmmmmmm?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""............................Battle? Did something happen?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Whaat?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""Where in this rose garden? Where did those spears and towers that you grew fall to? ............Nowhere, right? ......In other words, it's just like the insides of a Braun tube."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......The insides of a Braun tube, you say?? *cackle*, what in the world are you talking about now...?"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""In this very moment, there is nothing at all in the rose garden. Towers may have sprouted with magic until a short while ago. However, that's just because we don't know what's inside the Braun tube. ......It is your interpretation that it was a magical battle, and that's nothing more than a claim. Right here, right now, there is nothing at all to prove that."
Ushiromiya Battler," This is how I argue back about that witch's battle just now. Right now, there isn't anything here, which proves that nothing happened...!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................Hahaha, hah-hah-hah-hah-ha! You know, obviously I can't make a huge mess when it's only the second twilight, and I do like that rose garden, you see? To prevent any damage, I fought inside a barrier. So it's only natural that it wouldn't have any influence on reality."""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""......That is your claim? Well, I guess that works."
Ushiromiya Battler," However! At this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden. So my claim that there was no magic hasn't been blocked!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""W, wait, wait, can you deny my magic with that mess?! It is impossible to prove that magic 'does not exist'! It's a 'Devil's Proof'!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""At this point in time, this garden is the truth! The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish. And there are no traces of magic here at all! So that battle between you witches 'did not take place'!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Wh, ......what the, th, that counter......?! That power, ...c, could it be...?!"""
Ronove,"""...Have you forgotten, Milady? It is the Multi-layered Worlds Contraction Technique. The power of a finite witch in contrast with the power of an Endless Witch. Only an Endless Witch would be able to understand it, and it causes the strongest effect for an Endless Witch."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Sch, 'Schrodinger's cat box'?! .........Th, ......that old hag of a witch...what an uncalled-for hint!!"""
Ushiromiya Battler,"""We've lost time. With the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses! Let me check the scene. I've been trudging along wasting time. From now on, I'll speed things up, okay? "
Ushiromiya Battler,"Take a seat, Beatrice!! It's finally the first twilight, isn't it? Let's start the real thing. Show me what you've got!!!"""
