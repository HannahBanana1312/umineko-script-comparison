Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hahahaha, wahahahaha! I never thought that Lady Bernkastel's piece would barge in at the very end...!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you. ......I was sure that you'd like it."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""What's with that piece?! Who was that person, who was it?! She didn't say her name! That's mean!! Hey, don't you think so too?!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...I have a general idea. ......Come on, normally, anyone would know."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Normally?! I don't get it, it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?! If she doesn't say her name, I won't, the players won't, everyone won't understand, right?!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............Beato, it's alright if you don't tell her. Right? Isn't she a funny kid?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""H, ...hmm. ......Lady Lambdadelta's naivete truly is precious and funny. ......*cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Why, why, why won't you tell only me, you meanie!! Then in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know! So tell me!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""......Hoh. A special secret, you say?! I want to hear, I want to hear...!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Bleah! If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that girl really was! The secret I know sure is awesome! After all, it's about as awesome as knowing that Santa-san is actually daddy!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Huh? *giggle*! I said it☆ Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that it turned your world upside-down, right?! Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........Your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""He came...wait, what do you me-an?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Lord Santa Claus only visits the homes of children with clean hearts. He didn't come to your place, did he?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Well, Lord Santa Claus is gracious. Unless you are a re-ally bad scoundrel, he will give you a present. After all, he even gave them to me!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........As you grow and your heart is hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he? How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hmm. He stopped coming when I was about 12. My maiden's heart awoke, and I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord Santa coming."
{f:5:Beatrice}," After I wrote 'Thanks for everything, that's enough. So make sure you splurge on the last presents', he stopped coming. Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too! How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady Bernkastel?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........I was pretty wild. ...It happened fairly early. I think when I was about 9. ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, trying to cut it off. ............What a painful age."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""So, ......as long as she can remember, Lord Santa Claus has never come to see Lady Lambdadelta, is it? ............He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""...Maybe we should have a doctor look at her. I hear that being too precocious can have a bad influence on the growth of mind and body. ...Yeah, there's definitely some of those. ...Bad influences."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hey, wh, what are you guys talking about!! Bleeeeah!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......If you're talking about that level of secret, it looks like it isn't worth listening to. Can I go now? I have to prepare for the next game."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Wha, hey, wait a sec! Tell me who that woman really was!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Well then, tell me this special secret first. If it's good enough, then I'll tell you."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!! Alright, I'll tell you, 'cause it really is a special secret! ......Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hmm. Just what kind of secret could that person have?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Ehheheheheh! I noticed who that girl actually is. Does anyone know? *giggle*giggle*! There was a hint in the way she talked."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," Remember, that girl said it a lot, right? 'Why don't you somethi~ng?', right?! Yes, that phrase is the main point! {c:86EF9C:Ebaa~}? Ebaa~? Yes! "
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"She was actually, Ushiromiya Eva!! What do you think?! Are you shocked?! Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Hoh...! I didn't notice that! ...Muu, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Nice job playing along with her, Beato. This kid's getting arrogant, so calm her down. See you, I'm leaving."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Wait, wait! It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!! Tell me who she really was!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Your secret was so incredible that mine just wouldn't match up. ...So in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret. I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, don't say it!! I'm still playing i-t!!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Ahhahahahahhahhahhahha... See you, Beato. The black tea was delicious. However, the repertoire of jam on the crackers was lacking. Add some gochujang chili paste every once in a while. It goes great with Russian tea. Later."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Oh, I see. I shall try it. I shall call for some after preparing for the next game. Until then, feel free to polish up your strategy at your leisure."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""Yes, I'll do that. This last game was pretty interesting. Later."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""He-y, wait a sec, tell me-!!!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*. My, my, you two really are close."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""..............................Yes, that's right. ...Oh, I really like you, Bernkastel. You could even say I love you."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," ......I want to gouge out your eyes so that you can see no one other than me. ......Oh, that would be truly wonderful. It'd be wonderful to dunk them in black tea. Aha!"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""To think that you would be so entranced, Lady Lambdadelta. ......I have a serious responsibility. Still, this last game really was close! I was a breath away from getting Battler."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""............Beato. Can I ask you something?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""What is it? I won't tell you that girl's name. *cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...When'll you stop fooling around? ...Do you even feel like winning?"""
,Lambdadelta threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of Bernkastel.
,...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere which had been there until a moment ago.
{f:5:Lambdadelta},""".........You know, I'm supporting you because you're supposed to be a witch who can win against Bernkastel. If you don't have the power to win against her, then I'll abandon you at any time, alright......?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""............How harsh of you. What about me dissatisfies you? ...As you know, my Lady, my game board is perfect. Lady Bernkastel will never be able to win..."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Yeah, that's right. Your board truly is impressive. It truly is an impressive and perfect game board that Bernkastel definitely cannot win in even after spending one hundred years, or even one thousand years."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"......That's why, in exchange for letting me borrow that, I made you a witch. .........If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a human. ...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ......you are nothing more than a temporary witch."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I, ......I understand. ...I am grateful to you..."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Don't speak so casually. I'll forgive that when Bernkastel's around, but I won't when she isn't. Recently, maybe you've forgotten your debt to me."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Th, that is, .........n, ...no, ......not so......"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""...Aah, you're as disgusting as I thought. You can talk the same way as usual. But be mindful of what you say. ......I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""H, ......hmm......"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Let's return to what we were discussing. ...Your game board truly is perfect. ......You should be able to defeat Bernkastel without any trouble. ...But that kid won't surrender easily. She'll challenge you over and over."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is no problem. ...It has been certified by you, Lady Lambdadelta. ......My game board is perfect."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Yeah, that's right, it's perfect. ............But are you, the player, perfect as well?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........What do you mean by that...?"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""What do I mean? That's what I want to hear. .........You play a lot in your game. ...At first, I thought you were speaking in riddles for Bernkastel's sake every now and then, as part of your tactics."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"............But I get the feeling that's not quite true. Rather than toying with the opponent in a match you can win, ......actually, you don't care whether you win or lose, right?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""R, ......ridiculous... How could that be..."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""You know what? Your role is to make Bernkastel surrender. In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity. ......As long as you keep trying to become the 'certain' victor, then I will give you my power as the Witch of Certainty. ............However."
{f:5:Lambdadelta}," If you fight in a way that doesn't deny any possibility of your loss, ...that's a different story."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Of course, this is a game... In the same way that Lady Bernkastel will lose if I win, ...there will be some days on which I will lose and she will win. The possibility of loss always exists. Therefore, I will-"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""..................This is why you're useless. There's no need for this to be a game board for you. It's alright if this is a bird cage to lock Bernkastel up here for all eternity."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"...What's the role of a bird cage? Making sure the little bird inside certainly never escapes. ......What's a bird cage worth if it has cracks that sometimes let a bird out?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},""".........O, of course, games exist for winning. So it is impossible for me to lose. ...Therefore, I will continue to win.........As you wish, for all eternity..."""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Good answer, that's alright. ......I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics. It was sometimes useful in this last game."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"............But you know? If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory, ............at that time, prepare yourself wonderfully, okay?"""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""I, I will not do such a thing... I swear it...!"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""............Because originally, you weren't even a witch, and at any time, I'll remind you what a truly shabby creature you were. ............If you betray my expectations. At that time, you can look forward to a fun, fun punishment game."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"...In the world of billions of Fragments, ......I'll send you into the most miserable Fragment and seal you there. .........You were miserable in the first place, so it'll be worth choosing a really miserable Fragment. ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""........................"""
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"""Oh, I love you Bernkastel. ...Scrabble your feet in Beatrice's bird cage as much as you like, and learn that you can no longer escape after one thousand years."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},"......And when you surrender, ...I'll train you so that you can't do anything other than cry in the palm of my hand."
{f:5:Lambdadelta},".........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"""
