Speaker,Original Witch Hunt (OG)
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...What sort of black tea shall I prepare next? Allow me to display every refined tea that ever was and ever shall be."""
,"""......Dried plum black tea. ......The kind at 200 yen a pack."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*...! ...For a thousand years, I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing. ...I will never tire of living in this world."""
,"""...............Beato. You don't have to display such hostility. ...I am just a wandering witch. I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""...*cackle*cackle*, there is not even a sliver of hostility. ...I am just terribly concerned about seeing that the legendary witch, Lady Bernkastel, is well attended to."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".........You misunderstand. I am powerless. Before a witch such as you, who possesses the dreadful power to kill an individual a hundred times, I am completely powerless."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That a powerless Lady Witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying. After all, that Great Witch, Lady Lambdadelta, was dethroned by you alone."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......I only won an endurance contest. She simply got tired."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""That is not what Lady Lambdadelta said though. ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, too much humility can be unseemly, Lady Bernkastel."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......That girl has a dreadful power. ............The power to kill an individual 'without fail'. However, 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world. No matter how many times you divide 1, you can never reach zero."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," That girl has the power to bring the odds of failure down to 'almost exactly zero'...the power to give rise to 'almost perfect certainty'. ......I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""However, you have the power to cause success without fail, 'as long as the odds are not zero'. ......Although you say 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself. ......How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......The power to kill an individual 'endlessly'......I think you're the more terrifying one."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Such jests. ......From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power. This is most certainly what one would call empty praise."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Call it flattery to make up for the cost of staying here. ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the {c:86EF9C:Fragments}, continually running from boredom. ......I simply came around because I'd heard that you'd started something interesting. Have no doubts that I will choose to leave as soon as you are no longer interesting."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*...! I, Beatrice, am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady Bernkastel as an observer. *cackle*cackle*! And so, your impression?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""............Lambdadelta is terrifying because of her cruelty...however, she is a girl I can understand. ...You do seem to possess affection, but I can't understand you at all. That's why you're much more terrifying than her."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! I am fickle by nature. Do forgive me. ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy trusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice, right, Lady Bernkastel?"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get. Unlike you. You, on the other hand, never let the dice fall from your hand."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," So, whatever the roll might have been, you're never disappointed. Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied 'without fail'. .........In that sense, you far surpass me."
{f:5:Bernkastel},".........You're one I really don't want to fight with. Inside of you, there's nothing but zero. That's why I can't win against you with my power. ...The worst compatibility. ......Perhaps Lambdadelta, on the other hand, has a good compatibility against you. Since she would be able to kill your 'endless'."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*! ......Oh yes, witches truly are the best people to drink black tea with. One doesn't get bored. *cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},"""......Then, I'm relieved. Boredom is the only poison that can kill me. ......So, don't kill me, alright? Lady Beatrice, Endless Witch."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""If such is your wish, I, Beatrice, shall show you an even better time. "
{f:5:Beatrice},"......In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away? It seems that the next tale would do more for you than a refill of black tea."""
{f:5:Bernkastel},""".................................."""
{f:5:Beatrice},"""Just wait for a moment. ......*cackle*cackle*!"""
{f:5:Bernkastel},............Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," I'd really like to lend you my power but, as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad compatibility. Unfortunately."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," First of all, about that girl."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," She does have the name Beatrice, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she is 'one individual woman'."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," See what I mean? In other words, she's not some human. Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," For example, this can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a game."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," First, take a good look at the chessboard.{n} Then, learn the movements and roles of the pieces.{n} Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," When you've managed to reveal all of these things, her heart will be exposed.{n} After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......I am being quite generous. In the past, when I had a human body, it took me a hundred years to notice even this much."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It's just like a spoon."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.{n} You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"......Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal prison."
{f:5:Bernkastel},......Don't get the wrong idea. I have no intention of becoming your ally.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.{n}...You're much like someone sitting in front of the television, yelling at the people on the other side even though your voice won't reach them."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"{a:c: SO, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A WITCH, RIGHT?}"
{f:5:Bernkastel},I intend to enjoy this endless tale that Beato is going to weave until I tire of it. But that alone won't hold my interest.
{f:5:Bernkastel},......That's why I'll lend you my power. It's all so that I don't get tired of this.
{f:5:Bernkastel}," I am the cruelest witch in the world.{n} Whoever the opponent may be, I'll certainly make them surrender."
{f:5:Bernkastel},"...Even if it's Beatrice, the Endless Witch, alright...? "
{f:5:Bernkastel},"You are my game piece. Give it your best shot.{n} I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight."
{f:5:Bernkastel}," Don't bore me, okay......?"
{f:5:Bernkastel},*giggle*giggle*giggle*.......
