# umineko-script-comparison

A bunch of CSV files I compiled to compare Umineko's script in different translations/languages.

You can view individual languages in their respective folders, or compare every translation at once using "Full Filtered" or "Full Raw". Filtered means identical entries are tagged with [=Lang] so you can tell at a glance that they are the same (the system is imperfect and some lines are technically the same but aren't considered as such because of minor differences), but if you prefer to see the text as-is, there is Raw. 

Github has a built in CSV viewer, so you can just click on the file you want to view and everything will be shown in a table. If you want a more configurable CSV viewer I would recommend the [Edit CSV](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv) extension for VSCode, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets.

If there's an issue with the alignment then open a Github issue or message me on Discord if you know me.
