# umineko-script-comparison

A bunch of CSV files I compiled to compare Umineko's script in different translations/languages.

You can view individual languages in their respective folders, or compare every translation at once using "Full Filtered" or "Full Raw". Filtered means identical entries be tagged with [=Lang] so you can tell at a glance that they are the same (the system is imperfect and some lines are technically the same but aren't considered as such because of minor differences), but if you prefer to see the text as-is, there is Raw. 

To view them in a better way I recommend using the [Edit CSV](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv) extension for VSCode, [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Calc, or [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).  

I may attempt to make it more easily viewable just using the browser but that's for later me.
